## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Migration Applied ‚úÖ
```bash
# Already applied locally
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT missing_email, sender_email, website FROM outreach_emails LIMIT 1;"
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Queue all prospects in Outreach Center with missing_email flag

- Add missing_email, sender_email, website columns to outreach_emails
- Remove email filter from daily-prospect-queue worker
- Add Website and Sender Email columns to Outreach Center UI
- Highlight prospects with missing emails (yellow bg + ‚ö†Ô∏è icon)
- Disable approve button for missing emails
- Full bilingual support (EN/FR)
- Update API to return new fields"
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
git push origin main
# Vercel will auto-deploy
```

### 4. Verify in Production

**Check 1: Worker runs successfully**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-growth-infrastructure.vercel.app/api/worker/daily-prospect-queue
```

Expected: `success: true` with no errors about prospect_email

**Check 2: Outreach Center loads**
- Visit: `/en/dashboard/outreach` or `/fr/dashboard/outreach`
- Click "Approval" tab
- Verify new columns appear: Website, Sender Email

**Check 3: Missing email highlighting works**
- Look for prospects with ‚ö†Ô∏è icon
- Verify yellow background on those rows
- Verify "Email required" text appears
- Verify "Approve" button is disabled

## Expected Results

### Before Deployment
- Prospects without emails were filtered out
- Lost high-quality leads
- No visibility into missing contact info

### After Deployment
- **ALL prospects** appear in Outreach Center
- Prospects with missing emails are **visually distinct**
- **Website links** for research
- **Manual email input** supported (future enhancement)
- **No data loss**

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

```bash
# 1. Revert code changes
git revert HEAD

# 2. Remove migration (if necessary)
psql $DATABASE_URL <<EOF
ALTER TABLE outreach_emails DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS missing_email;
ALTER TABLE outreach_emails DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sender_email;
ALTER TABLE outreach_emails DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS website;
ALTER TABLE outreach_emails ALTER COLUMN prospect_email SET NOT NULL;
EOF
```

## Success Metrics

Monitor these after deployment:

1. **Worker Success Rate**
   - Should be 100% (no more "Failed to queue emails")

2. **Prospects Queued**
   - Should increase (now includes prospects without emails)

3. **Missing Email Percentage**
   - Track `missing_email: true` rate
   - Expected: 30-50% initially

4. **Approval Workflow**
   - Admins can see all prospects
   - Can decline low-quality ones
   - Can manually research and add emails

---

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test worker flow
node scripts/test-worker-flow.js

# Test missing email flag
node scripts/test-missing-email-flow.js

# Both should pass ‚úÖ
```

---

## Post-Deployment

1. ‚úÖ Verify no errors in Vercel logs
2. ‚úÖ Check Outreach Center UI loads correctly
3. ‚úÖ Verify new columns appear
4. ‚úÖ Test with real prospects (wait for next daily run)
5. ‚úÖ Monitor approval workflow

**Ready to deploy? All tests passing! ‚úÖ**
