# ✅ Growth Copilot — Client Filtering Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

The Growth Copilot sidebar was showing relationship insights from **all leads globally** (including admin-only leads like "mike"). Fixed by filtering insights to show **only the logged-in client's leads**.

---

## 🔧 **Implementation**

### **Before (BROKEN):**

```typescript
// Always fetched ALL leads (admin mode)
const leadsRes = await fetch(`/api/leads?limit=10&locale=${locale}`);
```

**Result:** Client saw insights from other clients' leads.

---

### **After (FIXED):**

```typescript
let leadsEndpoint = '';
if (clientId) {
  // Client mode: fetch only this client's leads
  leadsEndpoint = `/api/client/leads?clientId=${clientId}&locale=${locale}&status=active`;
  console.log('[CopilotFilter] Mode: CLIENT');
} else {
  // Admin mode: fetch all leads
  leadsEndpoint = `/api/leads?limit=10&locale=${locale}`;
  console.log('[CopilotFilter] Mode: ADMIN');
}

const leadsRes = await fetch(leadsEndpoint);
```

**Result:** Client sees **only their own leads** in Growth Copilot.

## 📝 **Console Logging Added**

### **Admin Dashboard (clientId = null):**

```javascript
[CopilotFilter] ============================================
[CopilotFilter] Fetching relationship insights
[CopilotFilter] Client ID: admin (all leads)
[CopilotFilter] Mode: ADMIN
[CopilotFilter] Endpoint: /api/leads?limit=10&locale=en

### **Client Dashboard (clientId = abc-123):**

```javascript
[CopilotFilter] ============================================
[CopilotFilter] Fetching relationship insights
[CopilotFilter] Client ID: abc-123-def-456
[CopilotFilter] Mode: CLIENT
[CopilotFilter] Endpoint: /api/client/leads?clientId=abc-123-def-456&locale=en&status=active
[CopilotFilter] Total leads fetched: 8

**Note:** Only shows leads that belong to client `abc-123-def-456`. No "Mike Admin" or other clients' leads visible.

## 🔐 **Data Isolation**

### **How Filtering Works:**

**Admin Dashboard:**
```
GrowthCopilot (clientId = null)
        ↓
Fetch: GET /api/leads?limit=10
        ↓
Returns: ALL leads from lead_memory
        ↓
Filter: Leads with relationship_insight
        ↓
Display: Top 5 relationship insights (all clients)
```

**Client Dashboard:**
```
GrowthCopilot (clientId = "abc-123")
        ↓
Fetch: GET /api/client/leads?clientId=abc-123&status=active
        ↓
Join: lead_actions (by client_id) ↔ lead_memory
        ↓
Returns: Only leads belonging to client abc-123
        ↓
Filter: Leads with relationship_insight
        ↓
Display: Top 5 relationship insights (client's leads only)
```

**Result:** Each client sees **only their own leads** in the copilot.

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Test Admin Dashboard**

**Visit:**
```
https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/en/dashboard
```

**Login as admin**

**Click Growth Copilot button**

**Expected logs:**
```
[CopilotFilter] Client ID: admin (all leads)
[CopilotFilter] Mode: ADMIN
[CopilotFilter] Endpoint: /api/leads?limit=10&locale=en
[CopilotFilter] Total leads fetched: 25

### **2. Test Client Dashboard**

**Visit:**
```
https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/en/client/dashboard
```

**Login as client (e.g., contact@techsolutions.com)**

**Click Growth Copilot button**

**Expected logs:**
```
[CopilotFilter] Client ID: abc-123-def-456
[CopilotFilter] Mode: CLIENT

**Shows ONLY this client's leads ✅**

- ❌ Mike Admin (admin-only lead)
- ❌ Jane Smith (other client's lead)
- ❌ Any leads with `client_id != abc-123`

## 📊 **Side-by-Side Comparison**

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Admin Copilot** | Shows all leads ✅ | Shows all leads ✅ |
| **Client A Copilot** | Shows all leads ❌ | Shows only Client A's leads ✅ |

# ✓ Compiled successfully in 6.0s
# ✓ No errors
# ✓ Ready for deployment
```

## 📂 **Files Modified**

**`/src/components/GrowthCopilot.tsx`**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added conditional endpoint logic (admin vs client mode)
- ✅ Use `/api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>` for client mode
- ✅ Use `/api/leads?limit=10` for admin mode
- ✅ Added `[CopilotFilter]` logging prefix
- ✅ Log client_id being filtered
- ✅ Log mode (CLIENT or ADMIN)
- ✅ Log endpoint being called
- ✅ Log total leads fetched
- ✅ Log number of insights with relationship data
- ✅ Log names and emails of leads shown

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**Issue:** Growth Copilot showed all leads globally (data leakage)  
**Root Cause:** Used `/api/leads` endpoint regardless of `clientId` prop  
**Fix Applied:**  
1. ✅ Check if `clientId` is provided
2. ✅ If yes (client mode): fetch from `/api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>`
3. ✅ If no (admin mode): fetch from `/api/leads`
4. ✅ Added comprehensive `[CopilotFilter]` logging
5. ✅ Log which client_id is used
6. ✅ Log how many insights fetched
7. ✅ Log names/emails of leads shown

**Result:** Growth Copilot now shows **only client-specific relationship insights** when used in client dashboards, and **all insights** in admin dashboard! 🎉🔒✨
