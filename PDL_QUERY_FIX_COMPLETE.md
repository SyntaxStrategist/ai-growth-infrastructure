# PDL Query Fix - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ **Status: PDL Now Returns Prospects Successfully**

Date: October 21, 2025  
Issue: `prospectsDiscovered = 0`  
Resolution: Fixed PDL search query to use industry taxonomy mapping

---

## üîç **Root Cause**

The PDL API was returning 0 results because:
1. **Wildcard matching didn't work**: Query used `*software development*` wildcard
2. **PDL uses LinkedIn taxonomy**: Exact industry names required (e.g., "Computer Software")
3. **Query was too restrictive**: Single industry match with narrow filters

---

## üîß **Fix Implemented**

### **1. Industry Taxonomy Mapper**

Created mapping from your ICP industries to PDL's LinkedIn taxonomy:

```typescript
'Software Development' ‚Üí [
  'Computer Software',
  'Information Technology and Services',
  'Internet',
  'Computer & Network Security'
]

'SaaS' ‚Üí [
  'Computer Software',
  'Information Technology and Services',
  'Internet',
  'Cloud Computing'
]

// ... and 7 more industries mapped
```

### **2. Flexible Search Query**

Changed from restrictive `wildcard` to flexible `should` (OR) matching:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "must": [
    { "wildcard": { "industry": "*software development*" } }
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "must": [
    {
      "bool": {
        "should": [
          { "term": { "industry": "Computer Software" } },
          { "term": { "industry": "Information Technology and Services" } },
          { "term": { "industry": "Internet" } },
          { "term": { "industry": "Computer & Network Security" } }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **3. Widened Employee Count**

- **Before**: 1-500 employees
- **After**: 1-1000 employees
- **Reason**: More results while still targeting SMBs

## ‚úÖ **Test Results**

### **Local Test (Success)**
```
Industry: Software Development
Region: CA
Limit: 5

‚úÖ Found 5 prospects!
Total matches: 34,823 companies

Sample prospects:
1. forensik inc - https://forensik.ca
   Industry: computer & network security
   Employees: 9
   Score: 75

2. samsung knox - https://samsungknox.com
   Industry: computer & network security
   Employees: 4
   Score: 75

3. gdg cloud montreal - https://gdgcloudmontreal.com
   Industry: internet
   Employees: 2
   Score: 75
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **New Issue Discovered**

### **Timeout Problem Returns**

Now that PDL is returning prospects, the **full pipeline execution** takes longer than 60 seconds:

1. ‚úÖ PDL discovery: ~3-5 seconds
2. ‚úÖ Prospect scoring: ~10-15 seconds  
3. ‚úÖ Email generation: ~20-30 seconds
4. ‚úÖ Database saving: ~5-10 seconds
5. ‚ùå **Total: ~40-60 seconds** (hitting the 60s limit)

**Error:**
```
FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT
iad1::rbs6d-1761071542345-a66b0d6b72ee
```

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Option A: Re-enable Background Queue (Recommended)**

Since the pipeline is working but slow, we should go back to the background queue approach:

1. Revert to enqueue + worker pattern
2. Cron endpoint returns instantly (< 5s)
3. Worker processes job in background (unlimited time)
4. Since you're on **Vercel Hobby plan**, use manual worker trigger or wait for tomorrow's 8 AM run

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No timeout issues
- ‚úÖ Can process unlimited prospects
- ‚úÖ Better logging and tracking

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual worker trigger (or wait for scheduled run)

### **Option B: Reduce Pipeline Scope**

Keep synchronous execution but reduce workload:
- Limit prospects per run to 10-20 (currently 50)
- Skip email generation in cron (do it later)
- Only discover and score prospects

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Stays under 60s timeout
- ‚úÖ Synchronous execution

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Processes fewer prospects
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete pipeline execution

## üìä **Current System Status**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PDL API | ‚úÖ **Working** | Returns 34,823+ matches |
| Industry Mapping | ‚úÖ **Complete** | All 9 ICP industries mapped |
| Search Query | ‚úÖ **Fixed** | Flexible OR matching |
| Google Fallback | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limited** | Quota exceeded (resets tomorrow) |
| Cron Execution | ‚ùå **Timeout** | Pipeline takes > 60s now |
| Prospect Discovery | ‚úÖ **Solved** | No longer returns 0 |

---

## üéâ **Achievement Unlocked**

**The core issue is solved**: PDL now successfully discovers prospects matching your ICP criteria!

The timeout is a **secondary issue** caused by the pipeline working correctly but needing more time to process the discovered prospects.

---

## üìù **Files Modified**

- `src/lib/integrations/pdl_connector.ts` (79 lines changed)
  - Added `mapICPIndustryToPDL()` function
  - Updated search query structure
  - Widened employee count filter

---

## üöÄ **Next Action Required**

**Decision needed:** Do you want to:

1. **Re-enable background queue** (recommended for Hobby plan)
2. **Reduce pipeline scope** (fewer prospects, stays under 60s)
3. **Upgrade to Vercel Pro** ($20/month, 300s timeout)

The PDL fix is deployed and working. We just need to handle the longer execution time.
