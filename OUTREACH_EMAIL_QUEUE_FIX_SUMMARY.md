# Outreach Email Queue Fix - Executive Summary

## Issue
Worker logs "Failed to queue emails for approval" despite successful migration.

## Root Cause
❌ **NOT** RLS policies  
❌ **NOT** wrong Supabase key  
❌ **NOT** foreign key constraints  

✅ **ACTUAL CAUSE:** Prospects without email addresses were being queued for outreach, causing NOT NULL constraint violations on `prospect_email` column.

## Solution
Filter out prospects without email addresses before queueing:

```typescript
const uncontactedProspects = pipelineResult.highPriorityProspects
  .filter(p => !p.contacted && p.contact_email);  // ← Added email filter
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/lib/daily-prospect-queue.ts`
1. ✅ Added filter to exclude prospects without email addresses
2. ✅ Added logging to show how many prospects were filtered out
3. ✅ Enhanced error logging with detailed error information

### Documentation
- ✅ Created `OUTREACH_EMAIL_QUEUE_FIX.md` with full investigation details
- ✅ Created test script `scripts/test-worker-flow.js` for verification

### Test Script
```bash
node scripts/test-worker-flow.js
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Campaign created
✅ Found prospect with email
✅ Emails queued successfully: 1
🧹 Test data cleaned up
```

## Key Findings

1. **Service role key IS being used correctly** ✅
2. **RLS policies are configured correctly** ✅
3. **Service role bypasses RLS as expected** ✅
4. **Issue was data validation, not authentication** ✅

## Verification
- ✅ Test script passes
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Worker flow tested end-to-end

## Deployment Status
**Ready for deployment** - No breaking changes, minimal code impact.

## Monitoring
After deployment, watch for:
- `⚠️  Filtered out N prospects without email addresses` (informational)
- `✅ Queued N emails for approval` (success indicator)
- No more "Failed to queue emails" errors

## Recommended Follow-ups
1. Improve prospect discovery to prioritize finding email addresses
2. Add email enrichment step before scoring
3. Consider scoring penalties for prospects without contact info
