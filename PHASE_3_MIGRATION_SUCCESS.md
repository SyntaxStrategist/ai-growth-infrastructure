## **üîß Issues Resolved**

### **1. Duplicate Key Error**
- **Problem**: Multiple migrations with same timestamp `20241221`
- **Solution**: Renamed Phase 3 migration to `20241226` and removed conflicting files
- **Result**: Clean migration application without conflicts

### **2. Module Resolution Error**
- **Problem**: Next.js couldn't resolve TypeScript modules in `prospect-intelligence/phase3/`
- **Solution**: Moved Phase 3 files to `src/lib/phase3/` and updated import paths
- **Result**: API endpoints now load and function correctly

### **3. Migration Application**
- **Problem**: Supabase migration system blocked by duplicate key constraints
- **Solution**: Temporarily moved conflicting migration and applied Phase 3 independently
- **Result**: All Phase 3 tables created successfully
