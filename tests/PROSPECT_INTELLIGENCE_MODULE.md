## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

### Stage 1: Prospect Discovery (Crawler)

**Module:** `crawler/google_scraper.ts`

**Function:**
- Searches for businesses by industry + region
- Targets companies with "contact us" pages
- Filters by size (5-50 employees)
- Returns deduplicated prospects

**Development Mode:**
- Returns 8 simulated Canadian companies
- Industries: Construction, Real Estate, Marketing, Tech, Finance, Legal, Events, Home Services

**Production Mode:**
- Integrates with Google Custom Search API
- Requires: `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`

**Example Output:**
```typescript
{
  business_name: "Maple Leaf Construction Inc",
  website: "https://mapleleafconstruction.test",
  industry: "Construction",
  region: "CA",
  language: "en",
  form_url: "https://mapleleafconstruction.test/contact"
}
```

---

### Stage 2: Form Testing (Signal Analyzer)

**Module:** `signal-analyzer/form_tester.ts`

**Function:**
- Submits test inquiry to contact form
- Measures response time
- Detects autoresponder presence
- Analyzes autoresponder tone

**Scenarios Simulated:**
- **No Response:** 0 points (Construction/Law)
- **Slow Response (3h+):** 15 points
- **Robotic Auto-reply:** 45 points (Real Estate/Marketing)
- **Human Auto-reply:** 75 points (Tech/Consulting)
- **Personalized Auto-reply:** 85 points (Events)

**Example Output:**
```typescript
{
  prospect_id: "prospect_123",
  response_time_minutes: 180,
  has_autoresponder: false,
  autoresponder_tone: "none",
  score: 15,
  test_status: "completed"
}
```

---

### Stage 3: Automation Scoring (Signal Analyzer)

**Module:** `signal-analyzer/site_score.ts`

**Scoring Logic:**
```
Response Time Score (0-100):
  < 5 min    → 100 points (instant)
  < 15 min   → 90 points (very fast)
  < 30 min   → 75 points (fast)
  < 1 hour   → 60 points (moderate)
  < 3 hours  → 40 points (slow)
  < 12 hours → 20 points (very slow)
  > 12 hours → 5 points (extremely slow)

Autoresponder Score (0-100):
  None          → 0 points
  Robotic       → 30 points
  Human         → 60 points
  Personalized  → 85 points

Overall Score = (Response Time × 0.6) + (Autoresponder × 0.4)

Automation Need Score = 100 - Overall Score
```

**Priority Levels:**
- **Urgent:** 85-100 (critical automation gap)
- **High:** 70-84 (significant opportunity)
- **Medium:** 50-69 (moderate opportunity)
- **Low:** 0-49 (monitor only)

---

### Stage 4: Outreach Generation (Outreach)

**Module:** `outreach/generate_outreach_email.ts`

**Templates:**

#### Urgent (Score 85+)
```
Subject: ⚡ Quick note about {business_name}

Hi {name},

I tried your contact form earlier today and noticed there's no instant reply.

For a business like {business_name}, every lead matters. Visitors filling 
out your form expect immediate confirmation — and your competitors are 
probably already doing it.

Avenir AI turns form submissions into real conversations instantly — in 
English or French.

Would you like to see how it would work on your site?

Best regards,
Michael Oni
Founder, Avenir AI Solutions
```

#### High Priority (Score 70-84)
```
Subject: Idea to improve {business_name}

Hi {name},

I noticed that {business_name} uses a standard contact form without 
instant auto-reply.

In the {industry} space, the first to respond often wins the deal. 
That's why top companies are now using AI to respond in seconds — not hours.

Avenir AI helps you:
✅ Acknowledge every lead immediately
✅ Keep prospects engaged while you're busy
✅ Work in English and French automatically

Interested in seeing a quick demo?

Best regards,
Michael Oni
```

#### Standard (Score 50-69)
```
Subject: AI intelligence for your leads — {business_name}

Hi {name},

Most businesses lose leads because they don't respond fast enough to 
contact forms.

Avenir AI solves this by sending a personalized reply instantly — the 
moment a visitor fills out your form.

Every lead gets:
• Immediate confirmation (in English or French)
• An AI-analyzed summary of what they're asking for
• A booking option if you want

It's like having a 24/7 assistant, without the hiring.

Want to learn more?

Best regards,
Michael Oni
```

**Bilingual Support:**
- Automatically detects language (en/fr)
- Generates fully translated French versions
- Maintains Avenir branding in both languages

### Stage 5: Outreach Delivery (Outreach)

**Module:** `outreach/send_outreach_email.ts`

**Development Mode:**
- Logs email preview to console
- No actual sending
- Status: "sent" (simulated)

**Production Mode:**
- Integrates with Gmail API or SMTP
- Requires: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` or SMTP credentials
- Tracks: sent_at, opened_at, replied_at

**Example Console Output (Dev Mode):**
```
[OutreachSender] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[OutreachSender] To: info@mapleleafconstruction.test
[OutreachSender] From: michael@aveniraisolutions.ca
[OutreachSender] Subject: ⚡ Quick note about Maple Leaf Construction Inc
[OutreachSender] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[OutreachSender] 
[OutreachSender] Hi,
[OutreachSender] 
[OutreachSender] I tried your contact form earlier today and noticed...
[OutreachSender] 
[OutreachSender] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[OutreachSender] ✅ Email preview logged (not sent)
```

---

### Stage 6: Learning Feedback Loop

**Module:** `feedback/learn_icp_model.ts`

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Total prospects contacted per industry
- Open rate (% of emails opened)
- Reply rate (% of emails replied to)
- Average response time (hours)
- Priority score (0-100)

**Learning Algorithm:**
```
Priority Score Calculation:
  Base Score = Reply Rate × 0.7 (0-70 points)
  
  Bonus for Fast Response:
    < 24h  → +30 points
    < 48h  → +20 points
    < 72h  → +10 points
    
  Total: 0-100 points
```

**Insights Generated:**
- Top performing industries (by reply rate)
- Recommended next industry to target
- Success patterns (industry + region correlations)
- Performance trends over time
