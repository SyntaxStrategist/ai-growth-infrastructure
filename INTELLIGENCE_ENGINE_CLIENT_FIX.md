# ✅ Intelligence Engine — Client Processing Fixed

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

The intelligence engine was failing to process client-specific analytics because it was trying to query `lead_memory.client_id`, which doesn't exist. Fixed by joining through `lead_actions` table.

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Fixed Client Query (Line 485)**

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: clients } = await supabase
  .from('clients')
  .select('id, company_name'); // ❌ company_name doesn't exist
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data: clients } = await supabase
  .from('clients')
  .select('id, client_id, business_name, name, email'); // ✅ Correct columns
```

**Columns in `clients` table:**
- `id` — Database primary key (UUID)
- `client_id` — Client identifier for linking (UUID)
- `business_name` — Company name
- `name` — Contact name
- `email` — Contact email

---

### **2. Fixed Lead Fetching for Clients (analyzeClientLeads)**

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
let query = supabase
  .from('lead_memory')
  .select('*')
  .gte('timestamp', periodStart)
  .lte('timestamp', periodEnd);

if (clientId) {
  query = query.eq('client_id', clientId); // ❌ lead_memory doesn't have client_id column
}
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
if (clientId) {
  // Step 1: Get all lead_ids for this client from lead_actions
  const { data: leadActions } = await supabase
    .from('lead_actions')
    .select('lead_id')
    .eq('client_id', clientId);
  
  const leadIds = leadActions.map(la => la.lead_id);
  
  // Step 2: Get full lead data for those IDs within the time period
  const { data: leadData } = await supabase
    .from('lead_memory')
    .select('*')
    .in('id', leadIds)
    .gte('timestamp', periodStart)
    .lte('timestamp', periodEnd);
  
  leads = leadData || [];
} else {
  // Global mode: fetch all leads
  const { data: leadData } = await supabase
    .from('lead_memory')
    .select('*')
    .gte('timestamp', periodStart)
    .lte('timestamp', periodEnd);
  
  leads = leadData || [];
}
```

**Key Fix:** Join `lead_actions` (has `client_id`) with `lead_memory` (has lead data) via `lead_id`.

### **3. Enhanced Logging**

**New logs show complete client processing:**

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### **Tables Involved:**

```sql
-- Clients table
clients
├── id (UUID, primary key)
├── client_id (UUID, for linking)
├── business_name (text)
├── name (text)
├── email (text)
└── ...

-- Lead ownership mapping
lead_actions
├── id (UUID)
├── lead_id (UUID) → references lead_memory.id
├── client_id (UUID) → references clients.client_id
├── action_type (text)
├── tag (text)

### **Join Logic:**

```sql
-- To get client's leads:
SELECT lm.*
FROM lead_actions la
JOIN lead_memory lm ON la.lead_id = lm.id
WHERE la.client_id = '<client_uuid>'
  AND lm.timestamp >= '<period_start>'
  AND lm.timestamp <= '<period_end>'
  AND lm.archived = false
  AND lm.deleted = false;
```

## 🔄 **Complete Flow**

### **When Intelligence Engine Runs:**

```
1. Trigger: GET /api/intelligence-engine
   ↓
2. Query clients table
   SELECT id, client_id, business_name, name, email FROM clients
   ↓
3. For each client:
   a. Query lead_actions WHERE client_id = <uuid>
   b. Extract lead_ids
   c. Query lead_memory WHERE id IN (lead_ids) AND timestamp in range
   d. Analyze leads (intent, tone, urgency, confidence)
   e. Calculate: engagement_score, urgency_trend, tone_sentiment, language_ratio
   f. Store in growth_brain table with client_id
   ↓
4. Return: {processed: N, errors: 0}
   ↓
5. Client dashboard fetches: GET /api/growth-insights?client_id=<uuid>
   ↓
6. PredictiveGrowthEngine displays all 6 analytics cards
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Run Intelligence Engine**

```bash
# Production
curl https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/intelligence-engine

# Or local
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence-engine
```

### **2. Check Logs for Success**

**Look for:**
```
[Engine] Client count found: 3
[Engine] Processing client 1 of 3
[Engine] Processing client_id: <uuid>
[Engine] Found X total leads for client via lead_actions
[Engine] ✅ Insert/Update status: SUCCESS
[Engine] ✅ Analysis complete for: <business_name>
[Engine] Completed all clients successfully
```

### **3. Verify in Client Dashboard**

**Visit:**
```
https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/en/client/dashboard
```

**Expected:**
```

**All 6 cards should now display with data!**

---

## 🔍 **Verify in Supabase**

### **Check growth_brain table:**

```sql
-- After running intelligence engine
SELECT * FROM growth_brain 
WHERE client_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Should return records like:
-- client_id: abc-123-def-456
-- engagement_score: 78
-- avg_confidence: 0.85
-- total_leads: 8
-- etc.
```

### **Check clients table:**

```sql
SELECT id, client_id, business_name, name, email FROM clients;

-- Should return all registered clients
```

### **Check lead_actions:**

```sql
SELECT client_id, COUNT(*) as lead_count 
FROM lead_actions 
GROUP BY client_id;

-- Shows how many leads each client has
```

## ✅ **Build Status**

```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully in 5.9s
# ✓ No errors
# ✓ TypeScript validation passed
```

---

## 📂 **Files Modified**

**1. `/src/lib/intelligence-engine.ts`**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed clients table query (use `client_id`, `business_name`, `name`, `email`)
- ✅ Fixed `analyzeClientLeads` to join via `lead_actions`
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for client processing
- ✅ Logs client count, processing status, insert/update status
- ✅ Logs completion summary

**Key fixes:**
- Query `lead_actions` by `client_id` to get `lead_id` list
- Query `lead_memory` WHERE `id IN (lead_ids)`
- This properly joins the tables without requiring `client_id` in `lead_memory`

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**Issue:** Intelligence engine not processing clients  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect column names + trying to query non-existent `lead_memory.client_id`  
**Fix Applied:**  
1. ✅ Query clients with correct columns (`client_id`, `business_name`)
2. ✅ Join via `lead_actions` table to get client's leads
3. ✅ Added comprehensive logging for each step
4. ✅ Process each client and store insights with `client_id`

**Result:** Client dashboards will now show all analytics cards populated with data after running the intelligence engine! 🎉📊✨
