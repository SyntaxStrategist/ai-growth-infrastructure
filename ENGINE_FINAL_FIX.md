Error Handling: **COMPREHENSIVE** ✓  
Logging: **DETAILED** ✓  
Filters: **SAFE** ✓

---

## 🔧 **Critical Fixes Applied**

### **1. Robust Filtering (Handles Missing Columns)** ✅

**The Problem:**
If `archived` or `deleted` columns don't exist in the database yet, the query with `.eq('archived', false)` would fail.

**The Solution:**
- Fetch all leads in time period first
- Filter client-side for `archived !== true` and `deleted !== true`
- This handles NULL values gracefully (treats NULL as false)
- Works whether columns exist or not

**Code:**
```typescript
// Fetch all leads in time range
let { data: leads, error } = await query;

// Client-side filter for archived/deleted (handles NULL values)
if (!error && leads) {
  const beforeFilter = leads.length;
  leads = leads.filter(lead => {
    const isArchived = lead.archived === true;
    const isDeleted = lead.deleted === true;
    return !isArchived && !isDeleted;
  });
  console.log(`Filtered: ${beforeFilter} → ${leads.length}`);
}
```

---

### **2. Comprehensive Error Logging** ✅

**Added logging at EVERY step:**

```javascript
[Engine] Analyzing leads for client: global
[Engine] Period: 2025-10-08... to 2025-10-15...
[Engine] Executing Supabase query (with time range filter)...
[Engine] Initial query response: { rowCount: 1, error: 'none' }
[Engine] Filtered leads: 1 → 1 (removed archived/deleted)
[Engine] Fetched leads: 1
[Engine] Sample lead IDs: ['lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he']
[Engine] Sample lead data: [{
  id: 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he',
  intent: 'B2B partnership',
  tone: 'professional',
  urgency: 'High',
  confidence: 0.85
}]
[Engine] Starting metrics calculation...
[Engine] Top intents calculated: 1
[Engine] Analysis complete: {
  client_id: 'global',
  total_leads: 1,
  top_intent: 'B2B partnership',
  high_urgency: 1,
  avg_confidence: '85.0%'
}
```

---

### **3. Full Try-Catch with Stack Traces** ✅

**Wrapped entire analysis in try-catch:**
```typescript
export async function analyzeClientLeads(...) {
  try {
    // ... all analysis logic
    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[Engine] ❌ analyzeClientLeads failed:', err.message);
    console.error('[Engine] Error details:', err);
    console.error('[Engine] Stack trace:', err.stack);
    throw err;
  }
}
```

**Now you'll see EXACTLY where it fails!**

---

### **4. Safe Division by Zero** ✅

**Added guards for empty lead sets:**
```typescript
percentage: allLeads.length > 0 ? (count / allLeads.length) * 100 : 0
```

Applied to:
- Top intents calculation
- Tone distribution calculation
- All percentage calculations

---

### **5. Enhanced Store Logging** ✅

**Before:**
```typescript
console.log('[Intelligence Engine] Growth insights stored successfully');
```

**After:**
```typescript
console.log('[Engine] Storing insights to growth_brain table...');
console.log('[Engine] Insights data:', {
  client_id: insights.client_id,
  total_leads: insights.total_leads,
  period: `${insights.analysis_period_start} to ${insights.analysis_period_end}`,
});
console.log('[Engine] Supabase insert response:', {
  success: !error,
  data: data ? 'inserted' : 'null',
  error: error ? JSON.stringify(error) : 'none',
});
console.log('[Engine] Growth insights stored successfully, ID:', data.id);
```

**Note:** If there are no leads in the period, processed will be 0 but errors will also be 0 (not an error, just no data).

## 🗄️ **Database Requirements**

### **Option 1: Run Migration (Recommended)**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE lead_memory ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE lead_memory ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lead_memory_archived_idx ON lead_memory(archived);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lead_memory_deleted_idx ON lead_memory(deleted);

-- Set defaults for existing records
UPDATE lead_memory SET archived = FALSE WHERE archived IS NULL;
UPDATE lead_memory SET deleted = FALSE WHERE deleted IS NULL;
```

### **Option 2: No Migration Needed**
The engine now works even WITHOUT these columns! It:
- Fetches all leads in time range
- Filters client-side (treats NULL as false)
- Processes successfully

---

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Check Your Lead:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, timestamp, intent, archived, deleted
FROM lead_memory 
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

**Verify:**
- `timestamp` is within last 7 days
- `archived` is NULL or FALSE
- `deleted` is NULL or FALSE
- `intent`, `tone`, `urgency` have values

---

### **2. Run Intelligence Engine:**

**Local:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence-engine
```

**Or in browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence-engine
```

---

### **3. Check Console Logs:**

Look for these key indicators:

✅ **Success Indicators:**
```
[Engine] Fetched leads: 1 (or more)
[Engine] Sample lead IDs: ['lead_...']
[Engine] ✅ Global analysis complete and stored
[Engine] ✅ Processed: 1, ❌ Errors: 0
```

❌ **Failure Indicators:**
```
[Engine] Fetched leads: 0
[Engine] ⚠️  No leads found in the specified period
[Engine] ❌ Global analysis failed: ...
[Engine] Error details: ...
[Engine] Stack trace: ...
```

---

### **4. Verify in Supabase:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM growth_brain 
ORDER BY analyzed_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Should show:
- `total_leads = 1` (or more)
- `analyzed_at` = recent timestamp
- `engagement_score` > 0
- `predictive_insights` with EN/FR data

---

## 🔍 **Debugging Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: No Leads Fetched**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Fetched leads: 0
[Engine] ⚠️  No leads found in the specified period
```

**Fix:**
Check if lead timestamp is within last 7 days:
```sql
SELECT id, timestamp, 
  NOW() - timestamp AS age,
  CASE 
    WHEN timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'within_period'
    ELSE 'too_old'
  END as status
FROM lead_memory;
```

If lead is too old, create a new test lead or adjust the period.

---

### **Scenario 2: Leads Filtered Out**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Initial query response: { rowCount: 1, error: 'none' }
[Engine] Filtered leads: 1 → 0 (removed archived/deleted)
```

**Fix:**
Lead is archived or deleted. Run:
```sql
UPDATE lead_memory 
SET archived = FALSE, deleted = FALSE 
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Insert Fails**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Supabase insert response: {
  success: false,
  error: '{"code":"42P01","message":"relation does not exist"}'
}
```

**Fix:**
Run full `supabase-setup.sql` to create growth_brain table.

---

### **Scenario 4: RLS Blocking**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Supabase insert response: {
  error: '{"code":"42501","message":"permission denied"}'
}
```

**Fix:**
Verify service role policy exists:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to growth_brain" ON growth_brain
  FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

## ✨ **What Changed**

### **Files Modified:**
1. `/src/lib/intelligence-engine.ts`:
   - Removed `.eq('archived', false).eq('deleted', false)` from query
   - Added client-side filtering (handles NULL values)
   - Wrapped entire function in try-catch
   - Added comprehensive logging at every step
   - Added sample lead data logging
   - Added metrics calculation logging
   - Safe division (checks for length > 0)

### **Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Works with OR without archived/deleted columns
- ✅ Handles NULL values gracefully
- ✅ Full error visibility with stack traces
- ✅ Shows exact query results and row counts
- ✅ Logs sample lead data for verification
- ✅ Safe math operations (no division by zero)

---

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **1. Build:**
```bash
npm run build
```
✅ Build passes with zero errors

### **2. Deploy:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### **3. Test on Vercel:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/intelligence-engine
```

### **4. Check Vercel Logs:**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Functions
- Click on `/api/intelligence-engine`
- See real-time logs with all `[Engine]` messages

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **With Valid Active Lead:**
```
✅ Processed: 1, Errors: 0
```

### **With No Leads in Period:**
```
✅ Processed: 0, Errors: 0
(Not an error - just no data to analyze)
```

### **With Actual Error:**
```
❌ Processed: 0, Errors: 1
+ Detailed error logs showing exactly what failed
```

---

## 📝 **Quick Verification**

### **Step 1: Check Lead Exists**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lead_memory 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND (archived IS NULL OR archived = FALSE)
  AND (deleted IS NULL OR deleted = FALSE);
```

Should return `1` or more.

### **Step 2: Run Engine**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence-engine
```

### **Step 3: Verify Success**
Check console for:
```
[Engine] ✅ Processed: 1, ❌ Errors: 0
```

Check API response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "processed": 1,
    "errors": 0
  }
}
```
