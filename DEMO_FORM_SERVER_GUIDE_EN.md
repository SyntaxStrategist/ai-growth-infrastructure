## üìã Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Address already in use"**

**Error message:**
```
OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use
```

**Debug Steps:**

**Step 1: Check what's using port 8000**
```bash
lsof -ti:8000
```
This shows what process is using the port.

**Step 2: Kill the process using port 8000**
```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```
This frees up port 8000.

**Step 3: Try starting the server again**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Alternative Solution:** Use a different port
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8001
```
Then use: `http://localhost:8001/DEMO_CONTACT_FORM_EN.html`

---

### **Issue 2: "python3: command not found"**

**Solution:** Use `python` instead:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
