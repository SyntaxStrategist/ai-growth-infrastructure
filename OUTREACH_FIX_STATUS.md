# ✅ Outreach Email Queue Fix - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED & VERIFIED

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Worker error: **"Failed to queue emails for approval"**

## 🔍 Root Cause

NOT RLS, NOT authentication, NOT foreign keys.

**The real issue:** Prospects **without email addresses** were being queued for outreach emails, causing NOT NULL constraint violations.

```sql
Error: null value in column "prospect_email" violates not-null constraint
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

**File:** `src/lib/daily-prospect-queue.ts`

Added email validation filter:
```typescript
// Only queue prospects with email addresses
const uncontactedProspects = pipelineResult.highPriorityProspects
  .filter(p => !p.contacted && p.contact_email);
```

## 📊 Changes Summary

| Change | Lines | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Email filter added | 134-143 | ✅ Prevents NULL email inserts |
| Enhanced logging | 134-143 | ✅ Shows filtered prospect count |
| Better error messages | 267-272 | ✅ Detailed error information |

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Script: `scripts/test-worker-flow.js`

```
✅ Campaign created
✅ Found prospect with email
✅ Emails queued successfully: 1
🧹 Test data cleaned up
✅ Worker flow test complete
```

### Verification Steps Completed
