        <div class="script-text">
            What if I told you that every lead that hits your contact form gets instantly analyzed, scored, and prioritized - before you even see it? This is the only system that predicts your success rate before you even start.

        <h2>Demo Setup</h2>
        <div class="script-text">
            Let me show you exactly how this works in real-time. I'm going to submit a test lead, and you'll see it appear instantly with full AI analysis.

        <h2>Live Lead Capture</h2>
        <div class="script-text">
            Watch this - I'm submitting a lead right now. I'm filling out the contact form with: Name - Sarah Johnson, Email - sarah@constructionco.com, and the message: "I need an estimate for a kitchen renovation project. We're looking to start in 2 weeks and have a budget of $25,000. This is urgent as we need to make a decision quickly."
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            Now I'm submitting the form... and immediately switching to the dashboard.
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            Look at this - the lead appeared instantly with full AI analysis! See this score? High confidence means this is a hot lead. High urgency means call them within 5 minutes. The AI instantly understood this is a kitchen renovation project. It knows they're ready to start soon. It flagged this as urgent - don't let this one get away.

        <h2>Dashboard Deep Dive</h2>
        <div class="script-text">
            This is where the magic happens - your client dashboard shows you exactly what to do with each lead. Look at the priority ranking - this lead is at the top. You know exactly which leads to call first. All the contact details are right here - phone number, email, everything you need.

    <div class="script-section">
        <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
        <div class="script-text">
            Here's what this means for your business: Instead of calling every lead and hoping for the best, you only call the ones that are actually ready to buy. No more wasting time on tire-kickers. No more missing hot leads because you called them too late. This system has helped our clients significantly increase their conversion rates. They're closing more deals with less effort.
