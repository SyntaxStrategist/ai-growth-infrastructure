# ✅ Client-Facing SaaS Portal - Complete

## Overview

The Avenir AI Growth Infrastructure is now a **full SaaS platform** with secure, multilingual client-facing dashboards. Each client can log in with their API key to view their own AI-enriched leads in real time.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

### **Three-Tier Dashboard System:**

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/{locale}/dashboard`)
   - Full system access
   - View all leads from all clients
   - Manage clients and API keys
   - Password protected

2. **Client Management** (`/{locale}/dashboard/clients`)
   - Admin-only
   - Create/delete clients
   - Generate API keys
   - View client list

3. **Client Portal** (`/client/{locale}/dashboard`) ⭐ **NEW**
   - Client-specific access
   - API key authentication
   - View only own leads
   - Bilingual interface

---

## 2. Client Portal Features

### **Authentication Flow:**

```
1. Client visits /client/en/dashboard or /client/fr/dashboard
2. Enters API key (e.g., ak_1234567890abcdef)
3. System validates against database
4. If valid → Store session in localStorage
5. Fetch and display only that client's leads
6. Client stays logged in until they logout
```

### **Security Model:**

✅ **API Key Validation:** Every request validated server-side
✅ **Data Isolation:** Clients see ONLY their own leads (`client_id` filtered)
✅ **No Direct Supabase Access:** All queries via secure API routes
✅ **Session Storage:** localStorage with manual logout
✅ **Server-Side Filtering:** Database queries enforce `client_id` match

---

## 3. New API Endpoints

## 6. Usage Flow

### **Admin Setup:**

1. Admin creates client in `/en/dashboard/clients`
2. System generates API key (e.g., `ak_abc123def456...`)
3. Admin copies key and sends to client

### **Client Usage:**

1. Client visits `https://aveniraisolutions.ca/client/en/dashboard`
2. Enters API key in login form
3. System validates and stores session
4. Dashboard loads with client's leads
5. Client applies filters, views stats
6. All AI fields appear in selected language
7. Client logs out when done

### **Lead Submission:**

1. Client (or their system) sends lead via API with `x-api-key` header
2. Lead is enriched with AI analysis
3. Lead appears instantly in client's dashboard
4. Real-time updates (manual refresh for now)

---

## 7. Security Features

### **Authentication:**
- ✅ API key validated against database on every login
- ✅ Invalid keys rejected with 401 error
- ✅ Session stored locally (no server-side sessions needed)
- ✅ Manual logout clears all local data

### **Data Isolation:**
- ✅ Database queries filtered by `client_id`
- ✅ No cross-client data exposure
- ✅ Server-side enforcement (not client-side)
- ✅ API routes validate `client_id` ownership

### **API Security:**
- ✅ All queries via POST (no sensitive data in URLs)
- ✅ No direct Supabase access from client
- ✅ Supabase service role key never exposed
- ✅ Rate limiting ready (future enhancement)

---

## 8. Mobile Responsiveness

✅ **Responsive Grid Layout:**
- 1 column on mobile
- 2 columns on tablet
- 3 columns on desktop

✅ **Touch-Optimized:**
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Scrollable filters on mobile
- Collapsible sections

✅ **Adaptive Typography:**
- Scales from 14px (mobile) to 16px (desktop)
- Monospace for API keys
- Clear visual hierarchy

---

## 9. Translation System

### **How It Works:**

1. **Lead Submitted:** Data stored in original language
2. **Dashboard Loads:** Detects locale (EN or FR)
3. **Translation Layer:** Calls `translateLeadFields()` for each lead
4. **Caching:** Translations cached per `lead_id + locale`
5. **Display:** Shows translated AI fields, original message preserved

### **Translation Flow:**

```typescript
// Client dashboard loads
const leads = await fetch('/api/client-leads', { client_id });

// Translate each lead to match dashboard locale
const translatedLeads = await Promise.all(
  leads.map(async (lead) => {
    const translated = await translateLeadFields({
      id: lead.id,
      ai_summary: lead.ai_summary,
      intent: lead.intent,
      tone: lead.tone,
      urgency: lead.urgency,
    }, locale);
    
    return { ...lead, translated };
  })
);

// Display translated fields
<p>{lead.translated?.ai_summary || lead.ai_summary}</p>
<p>{lead.translated?.urgency || lead.urgency}</p>
```
