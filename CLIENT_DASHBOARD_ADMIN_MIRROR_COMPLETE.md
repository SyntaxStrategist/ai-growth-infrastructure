## 📂 **Files Modified**

### **1. `/src/app/[locale]/client/dashboard/page.tsx`**

**Complete rewrite — 1,200+ lines**

**Key Sections:**

```typescript
// State Management (mirrors admin)
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'active' | 'archived' | 'deleted'>('active');
const [filter, setFilter] = useState({ urgency: 'all', language: 'all', minConfidence: 0 });
const [tagFilter, setTagFilter] = useState<string>('all');
const [confirmDelete, setConfirmDelete] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [confirmPermanentDelete, setConfirmPermanentDelete] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [tagLead, setTagLead] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [selectedTag, setSelectedTag] = useState<string>('');

// Lead Management Functions
async function handleTagLead() { ... }
async function handleArchiveLead(leadId: string) { ... }
async function handleDeleteLead(leadId: string) { ... }
async function handleReactivate(leadId: string) { ... }
async function handlePermanentDelete(leadId: string) { ... }

// JSX Structure (identical to admin)
<div className="min-h-screen p-8 bg-black text-white">
  {/* Header with title, business name, logout */}
  {/* Stats Summary (4 cards) */}
  {/* View Tabs (active/archived/deleted) */}
  {/* Filters (urgency/language/tag/confidence) */}
  {/* PredictiveGrowthEngine (client-scoped) */}
  {/* RelationshipInsights (client-scoped) */}
  {/* Leads Table with action buttons */}
  {/* ActivityLog (client-scoped) */}
  {/* GrowthCopilot (client-scoped) */}
  
  {/* Modals */}
  {/* Toast */}
</div>
```

**Action Buttons (matches admin exactly):**

```typescript
// Active Tab
<button onClick={() => setTagLead(lead.id)}>🏷️</button>
<button onClick={() => handleArchiveLead(lead.id)}>📦</button>
<button onClick={() => setConfirmDelete(lead.id)}>🗑️</button>

// Archived/Deleted Tabs
<button onClick={() => handleReactivate(lead.id)}>♻️</button>
{activeTab === 'deleted' && (
  <button onClick={() => setConfirmPermanentDelete(lead.id)}>⚠️</button>
)}
```

---

### **2. `/src/app/api/client/leads/route.ts`**

**Added `status` parameter support:**

```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const clientId = searchParams.get('clientId');
  const locale = searchParams.get('locale') || 'en';
  const status = searchParams.get('status') || 'active'; // NEW
  
  // Fetch all leads for client
  const { data: leadActions } = await supabase
    .from('lead_actions')
    .select(`...`)
    .eq('client_id', clientId);
  
  // Filter by status
  const leads = (leadActions || [])
    .filter(action => {
      const leadMemory = action.lead_memory;
      if (!leadMemory) return false;
      
      if (status === 'active') {
        return !leadMemory.deleted && !leadMemory.archived;
      } else if (status === 'archived') {
        return leadMemory.archived && !leadMemory.deleted;
      } else if (status === 'deleted') {
        return leadMemory.deleted;
      }
      return true;
    });
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: leads });
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Active leads
GET /api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>&locale=en&status=active

# Archived leads
GET /api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>&locale=en&status=archived

# Deleted leads
GET /api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>&locale=en&status=deleted
```

---

## 🔐 **Data Isolation**

**All data is scoped to `client_id`:**

```
1. Client logs in
   ↓
2. Session stores client data (id, clientId, businessName)
   ↓
3. Dashboard fetches leads:
   GET /api/client/leads?clientId=<uuid>&status=active
   ↓
4. API joins lead_actions (by client_id) with lead_memory
   ↓
5. Filters by status (active/archived/deleted)
   ↓
6. Returns only client's leads
   ↓
7. All components receive clientId:
   - PredictiveGrowthEngine
   - RelationshipInsights
   - GrowthCopilot
   - ActivityLog
   ↓
8. Client sees ONLY their data
```
