# ✅ Development Mode Gmail Skip — Implementation Complete

## 📋 Overview

**Purpose:**  
Skip Gmail sending during local development to speed up testing and avoid hitting API rate limits or requiring Gmail OAuth credentials locally.

**Behavior:**
- **Development (`NODE_ENV=development`):** Gmail sending skipped, logged in console
- **Production (`NODE_ENV=production`):** Gmail sending works normally

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Location**
`src/app/api/lead/route.ts` → Gmail sending section

### **Updated Logic**

```typescript
// Send follow-up email via Gmail (skip in development mode)
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('[Lead API] 🧪 Skipping Gmail send (development mode)');
  console.log('[Lead API] Environment: development');
  console.log('[Lead API] Email would have been sent to:', email);
  console.log('[Lead API] Continuing with AI enrichment and storage...');
} else {
  // Production: Send email normally
  try {
    const gmail = await getAuthorizedGmail();
    // ... Gmail sending logic
    console.log('[Lead API] ✅ Email sent successfully');
  } catch (mailErr) {
    console.error("[Lead API] ❌ Gmail send error:", mailErr);
  }
}

// AI enrichment and storage continues normally for both modes
```

---

## 📊 Environment Detection

### **How It Works**

**Development Mode:**
```bash
# .env.local or package.json sets this
NODE_ENV=development

# Or when running:
npm run dev  # Sets NODE_ENV=development automatically
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
# Vercel sets this automatically
NODE_ENV=production

# Or when running:
npm run build && npm start  # Uses production mode
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Local Development Testing**

**Developer runs:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Submits test lead:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "message": "Testing locally"
  }'
```

**Result:**
```
✅ NODE_ENV=development detected
✅ Gmail sending skipped
✅ Console shows: "[Lead API] 🧪 Skipping Gmail send (development mode)"
✅ AI enrichment proceeds normally
✅ Lead stored in Supabase
✅ No Gmail API calls made
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Production Deployment**

**User visits:**
```
https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/en
```

**Submits lead via form:**
```javascript
await fetch('/api/lead', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@company.com',
    message: 'Interested in AI solutions'
  })
});
```

**Result:**
```
✅ NODE_ENV=production detected
✅ Gmail API called
✅ Email sent to: john@company.com
✅ Console shows: "[Lead API] ✅ Email sent successfully"
✅ AI enrichment proceeds
✅ Lead stored in Supabase
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Production Build (Local Test)**

**Developer runs:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

**Submits lead:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

**Result:**
```
✅ NODE_ENV=production (even though running locally)
✅ Gmail API called
✅ Email sent normally
✅ Mimics production behavior exactly
```

---

## ✅ Benefits

### **1. Faster Local Development**

**Before:**
- Gmail API call adds 2-5 seconds per request
- Requires Gmail OAuth credentials locally
- Risk of hitting API rate limits during testing

**After:**
- ✅ Instant response (no Gmail delay)
- ✅ No Gmail credentials needed locally
- ✅ No API rate limit concerns
- ✅ Focus on testing AI enrichment and storage

---

### **2. Simplified Local Setup**

**Before:**
```bash
# Required for local testing
1. Download Gmail OAuth credentials JSON
2. Set up OAuth consent screen
3. Generate refresh token
4. Add to .env.local
```

**After:**
```bash
# Only need Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

**Gmail credentials only needed in production (Vercel)!**

---

### **3. Production Unchanged**

**Vercel Production:**
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production` set automatically
- ✅ Gmail sending works normally
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Full email functionality preserved

---

## 🧪 Testing the Skip Logic

### **Test 1: Verify Development Mode**

**Run:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "message": "Testing development mode"
  }'
```

**Check console for:**
```
[Lead API] 🧪 Skipping Gmail send (development mode)
[Lead API] Environment: development
[Lead API] Email would have been sent to: test@example.com
[Lead API] Continuing with AI enrichment and storage...
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ No Gmail API calls in logs
- ✅ Lead still created in Supabase
- ✅ AI enrichment still completed

---

### **Test 2: Verify Production Mode**

**Run:**
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
npm start

# Submit lead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Real User",
    "email": "real@company.com",
    "message": "Real inquiry"
  }'
```

**Check console for:**
```
Using Gmail profile for sender identity: { ... }
[Lead API] ✅ Email sent successfully
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Gmail API called
- ✅ Email sent to user
- ✅ Lead created in Supabase
- ✅ AI enrichment completed

---

## 🔄 Test Script Integration

### **Updated Test Script**

**Prerequisites Check:**
```bash
# Test script now checks:
1. Dev server is running at http://localhost:3000
2. Supabase credentials are available
3. jq is installed for JSON parsing
```

**Auto-Detection:**
```bash
echo "🔍 Checking if dev server is running..."
SERVER_CHECK=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$BASE_URL")

if [ "$SERVER_CHECK" = "000" ]; then
    echo "❌ Dev server not running"
    echo "Please run: npm run dev"
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ Dev server is running (HTTP $SERVER_CHECK)"
fi
```
