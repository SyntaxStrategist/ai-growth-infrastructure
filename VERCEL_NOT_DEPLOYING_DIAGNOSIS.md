# üö® Vercel Not Auto-Deploying - Root Cause Confirmed

**Issue:** Git pushes succeed but Vercel doesn't auto-deploy  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY IS DISABLED OR BROKEN**

---

## ‚úÖ Git Status: WORKING PERFECTLY

```bash
# Latest commits on GitHub:
df8df75 - chore: trigger Vercel deployment (JUST NOW)
292df17 - Implement background job queue
699fae2 - Fix: Add worker polling cron
```

**All commits are on GitHub successfully.**

---

## ‚ùå Root Cause: VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY IS NOT WORKING

Since **THREE** successful git pushes have not triggered any Vercel deployments, this confirms:

### **Vercel auto-deploy is either:**
1. **Disabled** in project settings
2. **GitHub webhook is broken**
3. **Vercel account issue**

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Manual Deploy

Since auto-deploy isn't working, you MUST manually deploy:

### **Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)**

**Step 1:** Go to Vercel Dashboard
- URL: https://vercel.com
- Login with your account

**Step 2:** Find Your Project
- Click on: `ai-growth-infrastructure` project

**Step 3:** Go to Deployments Tab
- Should be at: https://vercel.com/[your-account]/ai-growth-infrastructure/deployments

**Step 4:** Check Latest Deployment
- **Look at the timestamp**
- **Look at the commit hash**

**Current Time:** ~4:55 PM EDT (Oct 21, 2025)  
**Expected Latest Commit:** `df8df75` or `699fae2` or `292df17`

### **If Latest Deployment is OLD (before 12:47 PM):**
‚Üí Vercel hasn't deployed any of your recent changes

### **What You'll See:**
- Latest deployment timestamp: Probably from EARLIER TODAY or YESTERDAY
- Commit hash: Something like `7272961` or older
- This confirms auto-deploy is not working

---

### **Method 2: Force Deploy via Vercel Dashboard**

**Option A: Redeploy Existing**
```
1. Click on the LATEST deployment (even if old)
2. Click the "..." menu (three dots)
3. Select "Redeploy"
4. Confirm
```

**Option B: New Deployment**
```
1. Click "New Deployment" button (if available)
2. Select "main" branch
3. Click "Deploy"
```

**Option C: Git Integration**
```
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Click "Disconnect" 
3. Click "Connect Git Repository"
4. Re-select your GitHub repo
5. This will re-establish the webhook
```

## üîç What to Check in Vercel Console

### **1. Deployments Tab**

Go to: `Deployments` tab in your project

**Look for:**
- **Latest deployment time** - When was the last deploy?
- **Commit hash** - Does it match `df8df75`, `699fae2`, or `292df17`?
- **Status** - Is it "Ready", "Building", or "Failed"?

**What it should show (if working):**
```
Latest Deployment:
- Time: 4:55 PM EDT (just now)
- Commit: df8df75 "chore: trigger Vercel deployment"
- Status: Building... ‚Üí Ready
- Branch: main
```

**What it probably shows (broken auto-deploy):**
```
Latest Deployment:
- Time: 12:30 PM EDT (or earlier)
- Commit: 7272961 (old commit)
- Status: Ready
- Branch: main
```

---

### **2. Settings ‚Üí Git Tab**

Go to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Git`

**Check these settings:**

#### **A. Production Branch**
```
‚úÖ Should be: main
‚ùå If different: Change to "main"
```

#### **B. Auto-Deploy Toggle**
```
‚úÖ Should be: ON (enabled)
‚ùå If OFF: Turn it ON
```

#### **C. Connected Repository**
```
‚úÖ Should show: SyntaxStrategist/ai-growth-infrastructure
‚ùå If disconnected: Reconnect
```

---

### **3. Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs Tab**

Go to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Cron Jobs`

**Current crons (from OLD deployment):**
```
1. /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue (0 12 * * *)
```

**After NEW deployment (what you SHOULD see):**
```
1. /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue (0 12 * * *)
2. /api/worker/daily-prospect-queue (*/5 * * * *)  ‚Üê THIS IS MISSING
```

**If you DON'T see the worker cron:**
‚Üí Confirms Vercel hasn't deployed your vercel.json changes

---

## üéØ Action Plan

### **RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard in Browser**
   ```
   https://vercel.com
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project**
   ```
   Click: ai-growth-infrastructure
   ```

3. **Go to Deployments Tab**
   ```
   Check: Latest deployment timestamp
   Check: Commit hash
   ```

4. **Take a Screenshot and Share:**
   - Screenshot of Deployments tab showing latest deployment
   - OR tell me:
     - Latest deployment time
     - Latest commit hash
     - Deployment status

---

### **THEN:**

**If Latest Deployment is OLD:**

**Option 1: Redeploy**
```
1. Click on latest deployment
2. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build
4. Check if worker cron appears in Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
```

**Option 2: Check Auto-Deploy**
```
1. Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Check "Auto-deploy" toggle
3. If OFF ‚Üí Turn ON
4. If ON ‚Üí Disconnect and reconnect repository
```

**Option 3: Manual Deploy via CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
cd /Users/michaeloni/ai-growth-infrastructure
vercel --prod
```

---

## üìä Expected Results After Manual Deploy

### **Deployments Tab Will Show:**
```
Latest Deployment:
‚úÖ Time: Just now (within last 5 minutes)
‚úÖ Commit: df8df75 or 699fae2
‚úÖ Status: Building ‚Üí Ready (green checkmark)
‚úÖ Branch: main
```

### **Cron Jobs Will Show:**
```
‚úÖ /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue (0 12 * * *)
‚úÖ /api/worker/daily-prospect-queue (*/5 * * * *)  ‚Üê NEW!
```

### **Functions Tab Will Show:**
```
Within 5 minutes, you'll see logs from:
‚úÖ /api/worker/daily-prospect-queue
   [Worker] üîß BACKGROUND WORKER TRIGGERED
   [Worker] üîç Checking for pending jobs...
   (runs every 5 minutes)
```

## üîç Debugging: Why Auto-Deploy Isn't Working

### **Common Causes:**

1. **Auto-deploy manually disabled**
   - Someone turned it off in settings
   - Fix: Turn it back on

2. **GitHub webhook deleted/broken**
   - Webhook was removed or expired
   - Fix: Reconnect Git repository in Vercel

3. **Wrong production branch**
   - Vercel watching different branch
   - Fix: Set production branch to "main"

4. **Vercel account issue**
   - Payment failed, quota exceeded, etc.
   - Fix: Check Vercel account status

5. **Repository permissions**
   - Vercel lost access to GitHub repo
   - Fix: Re-authorize in GitHub settings

---

## üìû What to Tell Me

After checking Vercel Dashboard, tell me:

1. **Latest deployment time:** (e.g., "12:30 PM EDT")
2. **Latest commit hash:** (e.g., "7272961")
3. **Number of crons shown:** (e.g., "1" or "2")
4. **Auto-deploy status:** (Settings ‚Üí Git ‚Üí "ON" or "OFF")

This will tell me exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

---

## üöÄ Temporary Workaround

**While we fix auto-deploy, you can manually deploy each time:**

```bash
# After any git push:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Your changes are live
```

**Not ideal, but works until auto-deploy is fixed.**

---

**Next Step:** Check Vercel Dashboard deployments tab and tell me what you see!
