# Security Fixes Implementation Guide

This guide explains the 3 high-priority security fixes implemented in October 2025.

## ✅ Fix #1: Admin Password Hashing with bcrypt

### What Changed
- Admin password is now hashed with bcrypt (industry-standard, timing-safe)
- Backwards compatible: supports both plain-text (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and hashed (`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`) during migration
- Login flow remains identical for users

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Generate Password Hash
```bash
node scripts/generate-admin-password-hash.js
```

You'll be prompted to enter your password. The script will output:
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$10$...your-hash-here...
```

#### Step 2: Update Local Environment
1. Open `.env.local`
2. Replace `ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword` with the generated hash:
   ```
   ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$10$...your-hash-here...
   ```
3. Save and restart your dev server

#### Step 3: Update Production (Vercel)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Key**: `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
   - **Value**: `$2b$10$...your-hash-here...`
3. Delete the old `ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable (optional, for security)
4. Redeploy

### Security Benefits
- ✅ Passwords never stored in plain text
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison (prevents timing attacks)
- ✅ Industry-standard bcrypt with salt rounds
- ✅ Even if env vars leak, password remains secure

## ✅ Fix #2: API Rate Limiting

### What Changed
- New robust rate limiting middleware (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- Applied to all public API routes:
  - **Lead submission** (`/api/lead`): 60 requests per 15 minutes
  - **Prospect intelligence** (`/api/prospect-intelligence/scan`): 20 requests per 15 minutes (strict)
- Tracks requests per API key (authenticated) or IP address (unauthenticated)
- Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header

### Features
- **In-memory tracking**: Fast, no external dependencies
- **Auto-cleanup**: Expired entries removed every 5 minutes
- **Configurable**: Easy to adjust limits per route
- **Clear error messages**: Tells clients when to retry

### Configuration Example
```typescript
const rateLimitCheck = await rateLimit(req, {
  max: 60, // 60 requests
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // per 15 minutes
  message: 'Too many requests. Please try again later.',
});

if (!rateLimitCheck.allowed) {
  return rateLimitCheck.response!;
}
```

### Security Benefits
- ✅ Prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Protects against API abuse and scraping
- ✅ Limits expensive AI/database operations
- ✅ No impact on legitimate users (limits are generous)

## ✅ Fix #3: Zod Schema Validation

### What Changed
- New validation schemas (`src/lib/validation-schemas.ts`)
- Applied to all API routes that accept user input:
  - Lead submission
  - Client authentication
  - Admin authentication
- Validates data **before** processing (fail fast)
- Type-safe with TypeScript auto-completion

### Example: Lead Submission
```typescript
// Before: Manual validation (error-prone)
if (!name || !email || !message) {
  return error;
}
if (name.length > 100) {
  return error;
}
// ... repeat for every field

// After: One-line validation
const validation = validateData(LeadSubmissionSchema, body);
if (!validation.success) {
  return error(validation.error);
}
const { name, email, message } = validation.data;
```

### Validation Rules
- **Name**: 1-100 characters, trimmed
- **Email**: Valid email format, max 255 characters, lowercase
- **Message**: 10-5000 characters, trimmed
- **Language**: Must be `en` or `fr`
- **Password** (for registration): Min 8 chars, must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number

### Security Benefits
- ✅ Catches malformed/malicious data early
- ✅ Prevents injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, XSS)
- ✅ Consistent validation across all routes
- ✅ Clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ Type-safe (TypeScript ensures correctness)

## Testing Locally

### Test Admin Login
1. Generate password hash: `node scripts/generate-admin-password-hash.js`
2. Update `.env.local` with `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/en/auth-dashboard`
5. Enter your password → Should log in successfully

### Test Rate Limiting
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Submit lead forms rapidly (>60 in 15 min)
3. Should receive `429 Too Many Requests` error

### Test Zod Validation
1. Submit lead form with invalid data:
   - Empty name/email/message
   - Invalid email format
   - Message < 10 characters
2. Should receive clear validation error messages

---

## Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Generated admin password hash
- [ ] Added `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Tested locally with `npm run build` (should succeed)
- [ ] Tested admin login locally
- [ ] Tested lead submission locally

### Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Security: Implement admin password hashing, rate limiting, and Zod validation"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy. Monitor logs for any issues.

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to keep `ADMIN_PASSWORD` after migration?
**A:** No. Once you've set `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, you can safely delete `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The code supports both during migration for safety.

### Q: Will rate limiting affect my demo forms?
**A:** No. The limits are generous (60 requests per 15 minutes). Legitimate use won't hit them.

### Q: What happens if I submit invalid data?
**A:** You'll receive a `400 Bad Request` with a clear error message explaining what's wrong (e.g., "Email must be valid").

### Q: Can I adjust rate limits?
**A:** Yes! Edit the values in the API route files:
```typescript
const rateLimitCheck = await rateLimit(req, {
  max: 100, // Change this
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // Or this
});
```

### Q: Does this change break existing integrations?
**A:** No. All changes are backwards-compatible and non-breaking:
- Admin login works the same
- API endpoints remain unchanged
- Only invalid data is rejected (which would have failed anyway)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Review browser console for client-side errors
3. Test locally first with `npm run dev`
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
