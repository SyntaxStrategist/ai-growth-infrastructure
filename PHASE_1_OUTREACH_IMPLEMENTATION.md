```

### Daily Limits
- **Phase 1**: 50 approved emails per day
- **Phase 2**: 150 approved emails per day (future)
- **Phase 3**: 300 approved emails per day (future)

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/en/dashboard/outreach` or `/fr/dashboard/outreach`
   - Authenticate with admin credentials

2. **Review Pending Emails**
   - Click on the "Approval" tab
   - Review each email in the pending queue
   - Use "Preview" to see full email content

3. **Approve or Reject**
   - Click ‚úÖ "Approve" to approve for sending
   - Click üóëÔ∏è "Reject" to reject the email
   - Monitor daily limit counter

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - View real-time metrics in the Performance panel
   - Track open rates, reply rates, and engagement
   - Use time period filters for different views

### For System Administrators

1. **Set Up Cron Jobs**
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab for 9 AM EST daily
   0 14 * * * curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/daily-outreach-report
   ```

2. **Monitor Reports**
   - Reports are automatically generated daily
   - Stored in `/reports/` directory
   - Available in both JSON and HTML formats

3. **Database Management**
   - Monitor table sizes and performance
   - Set up appropriate indexes for large datasets
   - Regular cleanup of old tracking data

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All outreach endpoints require admin authentication
   - Cron jobs use separate authentication tokens
   - Development mode allows bypass for testing

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Daily approval limits prevent abuse
   - Server-side enforcement of limits
   - Real-time limit tracking and display

3. **Data Protection**
   - All email content is stored securely
   - Audit trail for all approval/rejection actions
   - Proper error handling and logging

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2 & 3)

1. **Semi-Automated Mode**
   - Automated approval for high-confidence emails
   - Manual review for edge cases
   - Machine learning-based scoring

2. **Full Automation**
   - Complete automated approval workflow
   - Advanced personalization
   - Multi-channel outreach (LinkedIn, phone)

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - A/B testing for email templates
   - Predictive analytics for optimal send times
   - Advanced conversion tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify admin credentials are correct
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Ensure proper headers are sent

2. **Daily Limit Reached**
   - Wait until next day for limit reset
   - Check approval count in performance panel
   - Verify system date/time is correct

3. **Email Preview Issues**
   - Check email content is valid HTML
   - Verify template system is working
   - Check browser console for errors

### Logs and Monitoring

- All actions are logged to console with `[OutreachApprove]`, `[OutreachPending]`, etc. prefixes
- Database operations are logged with detailed error information
- Performance metrics are tracked in real-time
- Daily reports include comprehensive activity logs
