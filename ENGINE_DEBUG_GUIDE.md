```

---

## üîç **Common Error Scenarios**

### **Error 1: Table Doesn't Exist**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Error code: 42P01
[Engine] Error message: relation "growth_brain" does not exist
```

**Fix:**
Run `supabase-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to create the table.

---

### **Error 2: Column Missing**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Error code: 42703
[Engine] Error message: column "some_column" does not exist
```

**Fix:**
Check which column is missing and add it to growth_brain table.

---

### **Error 3: Type Mismatch**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Error code: 42804
[Engine] Error message: column "avg_confidence" is of type numeric but expression is of type text
```

**Fix:**
The data type being inserted doesn't match the column type. Check the schema.

---

### **Error 4: NULL Violation**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Error code: 23502
[Engine] Error message: null value in column "some_column" violates not-null constraint
```

**Fix:**
A required column is receiving NULL. Check which field in the insights object is NULL.

---

### **Error 5: RLS Blocking**

**Console Shows:**
```
[Engine] Error code: 42501
[Engine] Error message: new row violates row-level security policy
```

**Fix:**
Service role doesn't have permission. Run:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to growth_brain" ON growth_brain
  FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

## üß™ **Testing Procedure**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Lead**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  timestamp,
  timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AS within_period,
  COALESCE(archived, FALSE) AS archived,
  COALESCE(deleted, FALSE) AS deleted,
  intent,
  tone,
  urgency,
  confidence_score
FROM lead_memory 
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

**Expected:**
- `within_period = true`
- `archived = false`
- `deleted = false`
- `intent`, `tone`, `urgency` NOT NULL

---

### **Step 2: Check growth_brain Table**
```sql
-- Verify table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM growth_brain;

-- Check schema
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'growth_brain'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

**Expected Columns:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `client_id` (uuid, nullable)
- `analysis_period_start` (timestamptz)
- `analysis_period_end` (timestamptz)
- `total_leads` (integer)
- `top_intents` (jsonb)
- `urgency_distribution` (jsonb)
- `urgency_trend_percentage` (numeric)
- `tone_distribution` (jsonb)
- `tone_sentiment_score` (numeric)
- `avg_confidence` (numeric)
- `confidence_trajectory` (jsonb)
- `language_ratio` (jsonb)
- `engagement_score` (numeric)
- `predictive_insights` (jsonb)
- `analyzed_at` (timestamptz, default NOW())
- `created_at` (timestamptz, default NOW())

---

### **Step 3: Run Intelligence Engine**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence-engine
```

---

### **Step 4: Read the Logs**

The logs will tell you EXACTLY what's happening:

**If it succeeds:**
```
[Engine] ‚úÖ Processed: 1, ‚ùå Errors: 0
```

**If it fails:**
```
[Engine] ‚ùå INSERT FAILED
[Engine] Error code: XXXXX
[Engine] Error message: (the exact problem)
[Engine] Error details (full): { ... }
```

**Copy the error details and the exact error code to debug further.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Table Missing**
```sql
-- Run complete supabase-setup.sql
-- OR create just growth_brain:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS growth_brain (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  analysis_period_start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  analysis_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  total_leads INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  top_intents JSONB,
  urgency_distribution JSONB,
  urgency_trend_percentage NUMERIC(5,2),
  tone_distribution JSONB,
  tone_sentiment_score NUMERIC(5,2),
  avg_confidence NUMERIC(5,2),
  confidence_trajectory JSONB,
  language_ratio JSONB,
  engagement_score NUMERIC(5,2),
  predictive_insights JSONB,
  analyzed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE growth_brain ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to growth_brain" ON growth_brain
  FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

### **Fix 2: Lead Too Old**
```sql
-- Update timestamp to be recent
UPDATE lead_memory 
SET timestamp = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

---

### **Fix 3: Lead Archived/Deleted**
```sql
UPDATE lead_memory 
SET archived = FALSE, deleted = FALSE
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

---

### **Fix 4: Missing AI Fields**
```sql
-- Check if lead has AI enrichment
SELECT id, intent, tone, urgency, confidence_score
FROM lead_memory 
WHERE id = 'lead_1760462469775_asygrt3he';
```

If any are NULL, the lead wasn't enriched. Re-process it through `/api/lead`.

---

## ‚úÖ **What to Expect**

**After running the endpoint, you'll see one of these outcomes:**

### **‚úÖ Success:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "processed": 1, "errors": 0 },
  "message": "Processed 1 analyses with 0 errors"
}
```

Console shows:
- Fetched 1+ leads
- Analysis completed
- Insert succeeded
- ‚úÖ Processed: 1

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è No Data:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "processed": 0, "errors": 0 },
  "message": "Processed 0 analyses with 0 errors"
}
```

Console shows:
- Fetched 0 leads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No leads found in period

**Not an error - just no data to analyze. Lead might be too old.**

---

### **‚ùå Error:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "processed": 0, "errors": 1 },
  "message": "Processed 0 analyses with 1 errors"
}
```

Console shows:
- ‚ùå INSERT FAILED (or other error)
- Error code: XXXXX
- Error message: (exact problem)
- Full error details

**This will tell you EXACTLY what to fix!**

## üéØ **Summary**

**The Intelligence Engine now has:**
1. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging at EVERY step
2. ‚úÖ Full error details with codes, messages, hints
3. ‚úÖ Sample lead data display
4. ‚úÖ Complete insights object logging
5. ‚úÖ INSERT response details
6. ‚úÖ Stack traces on all errors
7. ‚úÖ Client-side filtering (handles NULL values)
8. ‚úÖ Safe math (no division errors)

**When you run it, the logs will tell you:**
- Exactly how many leads were found ‚úì
- Which specific leads were processed ‚úì
- The complete data being inserted ‚úì
- Whether the insert succeeded ‚úì
- The EXACT error if it failed ‚úì

**No more guessing - full transparency!** üîç
