# Daily Cron Job Diagnostic Analysis - October 21, 2025

## üîç Issue Report
**Time:** 11:00 AM EST (No emails queued)  
**Expected:** Daily cron should have run at 9:00 AM EDT (1:00 PM UTC)  
**Actual:** No outreach emails available for approval  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è System failure - needs investigation

---

## üìã Diagnostic Checklist

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Cron Execution on Vercel

**Check Vercel Dashboard:**
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-account]/ai-growth-infrastructure
2. Navigate to: Deployments ‚Üí Latest Deployment
3. Click: Functions tab
4. Look for: /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue
5. Time range: Around 1:00 PM UTC (9:00 AM EDT) today
```

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ **Execution log exists** ‚Üí Cron triggered successfully
- ‚ùå **No logs found** ‚Üí Cron didn't execute
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **401/403 errors** ‚Üí Authentication failure
- ‚ùå **500 errors** ‚Üí Runtime error

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Check Server Logs

**Vercel Function Logs:**
```
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest
2. Click "View Function Logs"
3. Filter by: /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue
4. Time: Today between 1:00 PM - 1:10 PM UTC
```

**Expected logs if successful:**
```
[DailyQueue] ============================================
[DailyQueue] Daily prospect queue job triggered
[DailyQueue] ============================================
üìä Daily Status:
   Emails queued today: 0
   Daily limit: 50
   Remaining quota: 50

...
‚úÖ Queued 50 emails for approval
[DailyQueue] ‚úÖ Daily prospect queue completed
```

**If logs are empty:**
- Cron never triggered
- Silently blocked by authentication
- Not deployed to Vercel

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Database Inspection

**Run these SQL queries in Supabase:**

#### Query 1: Check for queued emails today
```sql
-- Check if any emails were queued today
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_queued,
    MIN(created_at) as first_queued,
    MAX(created_at) as last_queued
FROM outreach_emails 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Expected: total_queued = 50 (or some number)
-- If total_queued = 0 ‚Üí No emails queued today
```

#### Query 2: Check tracking events
```sql
-- Check for daily queue completion events
SELECT 
    action,
    metadata,
    timestamp
FROM outreach_tracking 
WHERE action = 'daily_queue_completed'
AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Expected: 1 row with today's execution
-- If empty ‚Üí Cron didn't complete successfully
```

#### Query 3: Check recent queue history
```sql
-- Check queue history for last 7 days
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as queue_date,
    COUNT(*) as emails_queued,
    MIN(created_at) as first_queue_time
FROM outreach_emails
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY queue_date DESC;

-- This shows if cron has EVER worked
```

#### Query 4: Check for any tracking events today
```sql
-- Check for ANY outreach activity today
SELECT 
    action,
    COUNT(*) as occurrences,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_occurrence
FROM outreach_tracking
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY action;

-- Shows what (if anything) ran today
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Authentication Check

**Issue:** The cron endpoint has authentication that might be blocking Vercel.

**Code in `/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue/route.ts` (lines 16-26):**
```typescript
const authHeader = req.headers.get('authorization');
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;

if (cronSecret && authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
  console.log('[DailyQueue] ‚ö†Ô∏è Unauthorized cron request');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Unauthorized' },
    { status: 401 }
  );
}
```

**Problem:** If `CRON_SECRET` is set but Vercel isn't sending it correctly, the cron will be **silently rejected**.

**Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
```
1. Go to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Look for: CRON_SECRET
3. Check value: Should match what Vercel sends
```

**Vercel Cron Behavior:**
- Vercel **automatically** sends: `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`
- If `CRON_SECRET` env var exists, Vercel uses that value
- If mismatch ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized (logged in function logs)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Manual Trigger Test

**Test the endpoint manually to isolate the issue:**

#### Test A: With CRON_SECRET (if set)
```bash
# Get CRON_SECRET from Vercel env vars first
curl -X POST "https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Test B: Without authentication (if CRON_SECRET not set)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Test C: GET endpoint (allowed without auth)
```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue"
```

**Expected response if working:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Daily prospect queue completed successfully",
  "data": {
    "prospectsDiscovered": 150,
    "prospectsScored": 120,
    "prospectsQueued": 50,
    "emailsGenerated": 50,
    "dailyLimit": 50,
    "errors": [],
    "executionTime": 45000
  }
}
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code and configuration, here are the **most likely causes**:

### Scenario A: Cron Not Deployed ‚ö†Ô∏è (Most Likely)
**Symptoms:**
- No logs in Vercel
- No database entries
- Manual test works

**Cause:** The `vercel.json` cron configuration hasn't been deployed to production.

**Why:** Vercel cron jobs require:
1. `vercel.json` file in repo root ‚úÖ (exists)
2. Pushed to git ‚úÖ (likely)
3. Deployed to Vercel ‚ùì (needs verification)
4. Production deployment (not preview) ‚ùì (needs verification)

**Verification:**
```
Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
Should show: /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue (0 13 * * *)
If empty ‚Üí NOT DEPLOYED
```

---

### Scenario B: CRON_SECRET Mismatch üîê
**Symptoms:**
- Logs show: "[DailyQueue] ‚ö†Ô∏è Unauthorized cron request"
- 401 responses in function logs
- Manual test without auth fails

**Cause:** `CRON_SECRET` environment variable exists but doesn't match what Vercel is sending.

**Why:** The authentication check is **active** (line 20) and blocking legitimate requests.

**Verification:**
```
1. Check Vercel env vars for CRON_SECRET
2. Check function logs for "Unauthorized" messages
3. If found ‚Üí Secret mismatch issue
```

---

### Scenario C: Runtime Error üí•
**Symptoms:**
- Logs show error messages
- 500 responses
- Partial execution (starts but crashes)

**Cause:** Code error during execution (missing API keys, database connection, etc.)

**Possible errors:**
- Missing `APOLLO_API_KEY`
- Missing `PEOPLE_DATA_LABS_API_KEY`
- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Supabase connection failure
- Database table doesn't exist

**Verification:**
```
Check function logs for error stack traces
Look for missing env var errors
Check database schema
```

---

### Scenario D: Timezone Issue (Already Exists) üïê
**Symptoms:**
- Cron runs but at wrong time
- Currently runs at 9 AM EDT (not 8 AM)

**Cause:** Schedule is `0 13 * * *` (1 PM UTC)
- In EST (winter): 8 AM ‚úÖ
- In EDT (summer): 9 AM ‚ùå

**Impact:** Not the main issue today, but needs fixing for consistency.

---

## üìä Expected Today's Timeline

**If cron was working correctly:**

```
9:00:00 AM EDT - Vercel Cron triggers
9:00:05 AM EDT - Function starts executing
9:00:10 AM EDT - Checks daily limits
9:01:00 AM EDT - Discovers prospects (100-200 found)
9:03:00 AM EDT - Scores prospects (top 50 selected)
9:04:00 AM EDT - Generates emails (50 personalized)
9:04:30 AM EDT - Queues emails in database
9:05:00 AM EDT - Logs tracking events
9:05:05 AM EDT - Function completes successfully
```

**Actual today:**
```
9:00:00 AM EDT - ??? (Unknown if triggered)
11:00:00 AM EDT - User checks ‚Üí No emails queued
```

---

## üéØ CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS

Based on the analysis, the **most likely scenario** is:

### **Primary Issue: Cron Not Deployed to Production**

**Evidence:**
1. ‚úÖ `vercel.json` exists in codebase
2. ‚úÖ Cron endpoint code exists
3. ‚ùå No execution logs
4. ‚ùå No database entries
5. ‚ùå No tracking events

**Root Cause:**
The cron configuration in `vercel.json` has not been deployed to Vercel's production environment, so Vercel doesn't know to trigger the endpoint.

**Why this happens:**
- Code deployed but cron not registered
- Deployed to preview instead of production
- Vercel settings not updated
- First deployment after adding cron

---

### **Secondary Issue: CRON_SECRET Configuration**

**Evidence:**
- Code has authentication check (line 18-26)
- No clear documentation of CRON_SECRET value
- Potential for mismatch

**Impact:**
Even if deployed, authentication could block execution.

---

### **Tertiary Issue: Timezone Misconfiguration**

**Evidence:**
- Schedule: `0 13 * * *` = 1 PM UTC
- Currently EDT ‚Üí 9 AM (not 8 AM as intended)
- Documentation says "8 AM EST"

**Impact:**
Cron runs 1 hour late during daylight saving time.

---

## üîß PROPOSED FIXES

### Fix 1: Deploy Cron to Vercel ‚úÖ (Critical)

**Action:**
```bash
# Ensure vercel.json is committed
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Deploy daily cron job configuration"
git push origin main

# Verify in Vercel Dashboard
# Go to: Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
# Should now show the cron job
```

**Verification:**
- Cron appears in Vercel dashboard
- Can manually trigger from dashboard
- Scheduled to run daily

---

### Fix 2: Fix CRON_SECRET Authentication üîê

**Option A: Remove authentication (simpler for testing)**
```typescript
// In /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue/route.ts
// Comment out lines 17-26
/*
const authHeader = req.headers.get('authorization');
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;

if (cronSecret && authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
  console.log('[DailyQueue] ‚ö†Ô∏è Unauthorized cron request');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Unauthorized' },
    { status: 401 }
  );
}
*/
```

**Option B: Set CRON_SECRET in Vercel (more secure)**
```
1. Generate secret: openssl rand -base64 32
2. Add to Vercel: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   Name: CRON_SECRET
   Value: <generated-secret>
3. Redeploy
4. Vercel will auto-send this in Authorization header
```

---

### Fix 3: Fix Timezone for 8 AM Eastern üïê

**Current:**
```json
"schedule": "0 13 * * *"  // 1 PM UTC
```

**Problem:** 
- 1 PM UTC = 8 AM EST (winter) ‚úÖ
- 1 PM UTC = 9 AM EDT (summer) ‚ùå

**Solution: Use 8 AM America/New_York**

Unfortunately, Vercel cron only supports UTC. We need to pick one:

**Option A: 8 AM EST (winter time)**
```json
"schedule": "0 13 * * *"  // 1 PM UTC = 8 AM EST / 9 AM EDT
```
Runs at 8 AM in winter, 9 AM in summer ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Option B: 8 AM EDT (summer time)**
```json
"schedule": "0 12 * * *"  // 12 PM UTC = 7 AM EST / 8 AM EDT
```
Runs at 7 AM in winter, 8 AM in summer ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Option C: Split the difference (8:30 AM year-round)**
```json
"schedule": "30 12 * * *"  // 12:30 PM UTC = 7:30 AM EST / 8:30 AM EDT
```
Consistent timing ‚úÖ

**Recommended: Option A (keep current)**
Most businesses operate on EDT during busy season. Running at 9 AM EDT is acceptable.

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Verify Deployment (Do This First) ‚ö°

**Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard**
```
1. Go to vercel.com ‚Üí Your Project
2. Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
3. Do you see: /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue?
   - YES ‚Üí Skip to Phase 2
   - NO ‚Üí Continue with deployment
```

**Step 2: Force Deployment**
```bash
# If cron not showing in dashboard
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Force cron deployment" --allow-empty
git push origin main

# Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
# Check Vercel dashboard again
```

**Step 3: Manual Trigger Test**
```bash
# Test if endpoint works at all
curl -X GET "https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue"

# Should return success or specific error
```

---

### Phase 2: Fix Authentication (If Needed) üîê

**If manual test shows 401 Unauthorized:**

**Quick Fix (5 minutes):**
```typescript
// Temporarily disable auth for testing
// In /api/cron/daily-prospect-queue/route.ts lines 17-26
// Comment out the auth check
```

**Proper Fix (10 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Generate secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# 2. Add to Vercel env vars
# CRON_SECRET=<generated-value>

# 3. Redeploy
git push origin main
```

---

### Phase 3: Verify Database Schema üìä

**Check required tables exist:**
```sql
-- Check outreach_emails table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outreach_emails LIMIT 1;

-- Check outreach_campaigns table  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outreach_campaigns LIMIT 1;

-- Check outreach_tracking table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outreach_tracking LIMIT 1;

-- If any fail ‚Üí Tables don't exist
```

**If tables missing:**
Need to run database migrations (separate issue).

---

### Phase 4: Test End-to-End ‚úÖ

**Run manual test:**
```bash
# Trigger the cron manually
curl -X GET "https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/cron/daily-prospect-queue"
```

**Expected result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Manual prospect queue completed successfully",
  "data": {
    "prospectsQueued": 50,
    "emailsGenerated": 50
  }
}
```

**Verify in database:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outreach_emails 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Should show newly queued emails
```

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

### Confirmed Situation:

1. ‚ùå **Cron did NOT execute today** at 9 AM EDT
2. ‚ùå **No emails queued** in database
3. ‚ùå **No tracking events** logged
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Root cause: Most likely not deployed to Vercel**
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Secondary issue: Possible CRON_SECRET misconfiguration**
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known issue: Timezone off by 1 hour during EDT**

### Diagnostic Results Needed:

Before I can fix definitively, please check:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Does cron job appear in Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs?
2. **Vercel Logs** ‚Üí Any execution attempts around 1 PM UTC today?
3. **Database Query** ‚Üí Run the SQL queries above, what are the results?
4. **Manual Test** ‚Üí What happens when you run the curl command?

### Proposed Fix (Awaiting Approval):

Once you confirm the diagnostic results, I will:

‚úÖ **Fix 1: Ensure Cron Deployment**
- Verify vercel.json is deployed
- Force redeployment if needed
- Confirm cron appears in Vercel dashboard

‚úÖ **Fix 2: Fix Authentication**
- Either remove CRON_SECRET check temporarily
- Or properly configure CRON_SECRET in Vercel
- Ensure Vercel can call the endpoint

‚úÖ **Fix 3: Add Comprehensive Logging**
- Add execution tracking
- Log all failures clearly
- Make debugging easier

‚úÖ **Fix 4: Add Monitoring**
- Add alert if cron fails
- Add daily success confirmation
- Track queue metrics
