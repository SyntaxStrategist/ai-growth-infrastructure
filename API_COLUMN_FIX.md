# ✅ Growth Insights API - Column Fix Applied

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem:**
API was ordering by `analyzed_at` column which doesn't exist in growth_brain table.

### **Solution:**
Changed to use `created_at` column instead.

---

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### **Query Order:**
**Before:**
```typescript
.order('analyzed_at', { ascending: false })
```

**After:**
```typescript
.order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

### **Logging:**
**Before:**
```typescript
console.log('[GrowthInsightsAPI] Analyzed at:', insight.analyzed_at);
console.log('[GrowthInsightsAPI] Query filters:', { order: 'analyzed_at DESC' });
```

**After:**
```typescript
console.log('[GrowthInsightsAPI] Created at:', insight.created_at);
console.log('[GrowthInsightsAPI] Query filters:', { order: 'created_at DESC' });
```

---

## ✅ **What Works Now**

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM growth_brain 
WHERE client_id IS NULL 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**This will:**
- ✅ Fetch the most recent global insight
- ✅ Use correct column name (created_at)
- ✅ Return latest record successfully
- ✅ Work with actual growth_brain schema

---

## 🧪 **Test**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/growth-insights
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "abc-123-...",
    "client_id": null,
    "total_leads": 1,
    "engagement_score": 63.75,
    "created_at": "2025-10-15T...",
    "predictive_insights": { "en": {...}, "fr": {...} },
    ...
  }
}
```

**Console Output:**
```
[GrowthInsightsAPI] Executing Supabase query (ORDER BY created_at DESC)...
[GrowthInsightsAPI] Query result: { found: 1, hasError: false }
[GrowthInsightsAPI] ✅ Found insight record
[GrowthInsightsAPI] Created at: 2025-10-15T...
[GrowthInsightsAPI] ✅ Returning insight data
```

---

## ✅ **Summary**

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Changed `analyzed_at` → `created_at` in query
- ✅ Updated logging to show `created_at`
- ✅ Updated query filter log message
- ✅ Kept all comprehensive logging
- ✅ Maintained error handling

**Build:** ✓ PASSING  
**Ready to test:** ✓ YES

**The API now uses the correct column and will fetch the latest insight successfully!** 🚀✨
