## 🛟 Troubleshooting

### Admin Login Not Working?
- Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is set in Vercel
- Check you're using the correct password
- View Vercel logs for errors

### Build Failed?
- Run `npm install` to ensure Zod is installed
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check for TypeScript errors

### Rate Limit Too Strict?
- Current limit: 60 requests per 15 min
- Edit `src/app/api/lead/route.ts` line 155 to adjust
