# ✅ Production Verification Checklist

**Deployment Date:** October 21, 2025  
**URL:** https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca  
**Status:** Worker deployed successfully ✅

---

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### 1. Worker Health Check ✅

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/api/worker/daily-prospect-queue
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "No pending jobs to process",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T19:56:17.327Z"
}
```

✅ **Status:** Worker is running without errors

---

### 2. Verify Outreach Center UI

**English Version:**
1. Go to: https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/en/dashboard/outreach
2. Enter admin password
3. Click "Approval" tab
4. Check for new columns:
   - ✅ **Website** column (should show 🔗 Visit links)
   - ✅ **Sender Email** column (should show "To be selected")

**French Version:**
1. Go to: https://www.aveniraisolutions.ca/fr/dashboard/outreach
2. Enter admin password
3. Click "Approbation" tab
4. Check for new columns:
   - ✅ **Site Web** column (should show 🔗 Visiter links)
   - ✅ **Courriel Expéditeur** column (should show "À sélectionner")

---

### 3. Check for Missing Email Indicators

When prospects without emails are queued, you should see:

**Visual Indicators:**
- ⚠️ Yellow warning icon before prospect name
- Light yellow background on entire row
- "Email required" text (italic, yellow) instead of email address
- "Approve" button disabled (grayed out)

**Example:**
```
┌────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────┬────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  Unknown Name   │ Tech Co Inc  │ 🔗 Visit │ To be selected │
│ Email required     │ Technology   │          │                │
└────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────┴────────────────┘
        ↑ Yellow background highlighting
```

---

### 4. Wait for Next Daily Queue Run

The daily worker runs at **8 AM EST** automatically. After the next run:

**Expected Results:**
1. Check worker logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Look for log entries:
   ```
   📊 Uncontacted prospects: N
      - With email: X
      - Missing email (manual input needed): Y
   ```

3. The `Y` number shows how many prospects need manual email input

---

### 5. Database Verification

If you have direct database access:

```sql
-- Check if new columns exist
SELECT 
  id,
  prospect_email,
  missing_email,
  website,
  sender_email,
  company_name
FROM outreach_emails
WHERE status = 'pending'
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** All columns should return data (some may be NULL)

---

```

### After This Update
```
Discover 50 prospects
↓
Queue ALL 50 for approval
↓
- 20 ready to approve (have emails)
- 30 flagged ⚠️ (need manual email input)

```

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Good Signs ✅
- New columns appear in Outreach Center
- Prospects without emails are highlighted
- Website links work
- No console errors
- Worker completes without "Failed to queue" errors

### Issues to Watch For ⚠️
- Missing columns (Website/Sender Email)

## 📈 Expected Metrics

After a few daily runs:

**Typical Distribution:**
- ~50-70% prospects will have emails (ready to approve)
- ~30-50% prospects will need manual email input
- This is **normal** - automated email discovery isn't perfect

**Action Items for Missing Emails:**
1. Click website link to research company
2. Find contact email on their site
3. *(Future)* Add email via edit modal
4. Approve and send

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor first daily run** (8 AM EST tomorrow)
2. **Check Vercel logs** for any errors
3. **Verify in Outreach Center** that all prospects appear
4. **Test manual workflow** with missing email prospects
5. **Track approval rates** for prospects with vs without emails

---

## 📞 Support
