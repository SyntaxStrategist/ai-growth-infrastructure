## 🔍 Question: What Happens When a Client Receives a New Lead?

### Current System Flow (End-to-End)

```
1. Lead Submitted via API
   ↓
2. Lead Stored in Database (lead_memory table)
   ↓
3. AI Enrichment (intent, tone, urgency, confidence)
   ↓
4. Email Generated (personalized for client)
   ↓
5. Email Sent Immediately (if in production mode)
   ↓
6. Client Can View Lead in Dashboard
```

## 📧 1. Email Generation & Sending

### Is Email Sent Immediately or Queued?

**✅ IMMEDIATELY SENT** (in production)

**Code Location:** `src/app/api/lead/route.ts` lines 353-421

```typescript
// After lead is saved, email is generated and sent immediately
if (client.ai_personalized_reply) {
  const emailContent = buildPersonalizedHtmlEmail({
    leadName: name,
    leadEmail: email,
    leadMessage: message,
    aiSummary: aiSummary,
    intent: enrichment.intent,
    tone: enrichment.tone,
    urgency: enrichment.urgency,
    confidence: enrichment.confidence_score,
    locale: locale,
    client: client,
  });
  
  // Email is sent immediately (production only)
  // Development mode: Email is generated but NOT sent
}
```

**Development Mode:**
- Email is generated but NOT sent
- Logs show: `🧪 Email NOT sent (development mode)`
- Code preview shown in console

**Production Mode:**
- Email sent immediately via Gmail API
- No queuing, no approval required
- Automatic on behalf of client

---

## 📮 2. Sender Email Address

### Which Address is Used?

**Current System:**

1. **For Avenir Internal Leads:**
   - From: `contact@aveniraisolutions.ca`
   - Sender Name: "Avenir AI Solutions"
   - Reply-To: `contact@aveniraisolutions.ca`

2. **For Client Leads:**
   - **If client has `outbound_email` configured:**
     - From: `client.outbound_email`
     - Example: `support@clientcompany.com`
   
   - **If client has NO outbound_email:**
     - From: `noreply@aveniraisolutions.ca`
     - Sender Name: Client's business_name

**Code Location:** `src/app/api/lead/route.ts` line 397

```typescript
console.log('[EmailAutomation] Sender:', 
  client.outbound_email || 
  `${client.business_name} <noreply@aveniraisolutions.ca>`
);
```

**SMTP Configuration:**
Clients CAN configure their own SMTP in the database:
- `smtp_host`
- `smtp_port`
- `smtp_username`
- `smtp_password`
- `outbound_email`

**But currently:** This SMTP config is stored but NOT used in the code. The system only uses Gmail API for Avenir's account.

## 👁️ 3. Client Dashboard Visibility

### Can Clients See Sent Emails?

**❌ NO - Clients CANNOT currently see sent emails in their dashboard**

**What Clients CAN See:**
1. **Dashboard Page** (`/client/dashboard`)
   - Lead count
   - Recent leads
   - Analytics

2. **Insights Page** (`/client/insights`)
   - Lead trends
   - Performance metrics

3. **Prospect Intelligence** (`/client/prospect-intelligence`)
   - Lead enrichment data
   - AI analysis

**What Clients CANNOT See:**
- ❌ Emails sent on their behalf
- ❌ Email content/subject
- ❌ Email timestamps
- ❌ Email status (opened, replied)
- ❌ Follow-up history

**Why?**
There is no "Sent Emails" or "Outreach" tab in the client dashboard. This feature exists only in the **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/outreach`).

---

## ⏱️ 4. Delays, Batching, and Limits

### Are There Any Delays or Limits?

**Current System:**

1. **NO Delays**
   - Emails sent immediately upon lead capture
   - No queue, no batching
   - Real-time processing

2. **NO Client-Side Limits**
   - No daily email limit per client
   - No rate limiting
   - No throttling

3. **NO Batching**
   - Each lead triggers one email immediately
   - One-to-one processing

**Admin Side Limits (Different System):**
- Admin Outreach Center has 50/day limit
- This is for **prospect discovery** (different flow)
- Does NOT affect client lead emails

**API Rate Limits:**
- Only limited by Gmail API quotas
- No application-level limits

---

## 🔧 5. Manual Admin Action Required?

### Is Admin Approval Needed?

**✅ NO - Completely Automatic**

**Flow:**
```
Lead Submitted
   ↓ (immediate)
AI Enrichment
   ↓ (immediate)
Email Sent
   ↓ (no approval)
Client Sees Lead in Dashboard
```

**Admin Involvement:**
- ❌ No approval required
- ❌ No manual trigger needed
- ❌ No review step
- ✅ Fully automated

**Admin CAN:**
- View leads in admin dashboard
- See AI enrichment
- Add notes to leads
- But emails are already sent

   - All emails go through Avenir's Gmail
   - No proper client email integration

3. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Could overwhelm with high lead volume
   - No protection against spam

| **Daily Limit** | No limit | 50/day |

## 🎯 Summary

**When a client receives a new lead:**

1. ✅ Lead is captured and stored immediately
2. ✅ AI enrichment happens in real-time
3. ✅ Personalized email is generated automatically
4. ✅ Email is sent immediately (production only)
5. ❌ Client cannot see the sent email
6. ❌ No approval, queue, or delay
7. ✅ Fully automated, no admin action needed

**The system is designed for:**
- Speed (immediate response)
- Automation (no manual steps)
- Personalization (client branding)

**But lacks:**
- Client email visibility
- Email tracking/status
- True client SMTP integration
- Rate limiting/controls

---

**Next Steps for Improvement:**
1. Add "Sent Emails" tab to client dashboard
2. Implement client SMTP usage
3. Add email tracking (opens, replies)
4. Add optional approval queue for clients
5. Implement rate limiting per client
