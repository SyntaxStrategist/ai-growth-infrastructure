## 📊 Data Flow

### **Conversion Flow**
```
Active Lead
  ↓
User tags as "Converted"
  ↓
lead_memory.current_tag = 'Converted'
lead_actions.conversion_outcome = true
growth_brain: event_type = 'conversion'
  ↓
Lead appears in Converted tab
```

### **Reversion Flow**
```
Converted Lead
  ↓
User clicks "Return to Active"
  ↓
Modal: Select reason
  ↓
Confirm Return
  ↓
lead_memory.current_tag = 'Active'
lead_actions.conversion_outcome = false
lead_actions.reversion_reason = 'Placed in converted by accident'
growth_brain: event_type = 'reversion'
  ↓
Lead appears in Active tab
```

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### **lead_actions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.lead_actions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES lead_memory(id),
  client_id TEXT,
  action_type TEXT,
  tag TEXT,
  performed_by TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- ✅ NEW FIELDS
  conversion_outcome BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL,
  reversion_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_lead_actions_conversion_outcome
ON lead_actions(conversion_outcome)
WHERE conversion_outcome = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_lead_actions_reversion_reason
ON lead_actions(reversion_reason)
WHERE reversion_reason IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Migrations Created**
1. `supabase/migrations/add_conversion_outcome_to_lead_actions.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/add_reversion_reason_to_lead_actions.sql`

## 📈 Analytics & Reporting

### **Metrics Available**
- Total conversions
- Total reversions
- Conversion rate (conversions / total leads)
- Reversion rate (reversions / conversions)
- Time to conversion
- Time between conversion and reversion
- Most common reversion reasons

### **Growth Brain Queries**
```sql
-- All conversion events
SELECT learning_snapshot 
FROM growth_brain 
WHERE learning_snapshot->>'event_type' = 'conversion';

-- All reversion events
SELECT learning_snapshot 
FROM growth_brain 
WHERE learning_snapshot->>'event_type' = 'reversion';

-- Reversion rate by reason
SELECT 
  learning_snapshot->>'reversion_reason' as reason,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM growth_brain
WHERE learning_snapshot->>'event_type' = 'reversion'
GROUP BY reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
