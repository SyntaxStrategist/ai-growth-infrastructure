## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Tag Detection Logic**
```typescript
const isConversion = tag === 'Converted' || tag === 'Converti';
```

### **Lead Filtering (Active/Archived Tabs)**
```typescript
const filteredLeads = leads.filter(lead => {
  const isConverted = lead.current_tag === 'Converted' || lead.current_tag === 'Converti';
  if (activeTab === 'active' && isConverted) return false;
  if (activeTab === 'archived' && isConverted) return false;
  // ... rest of filters
});
```

### **Growth Brain Logging**
```typescript
if (isConversion) {
  const learningSnapshot = {
    id: randomUUID(),
    event_type: 'conversion',
    lead_id: lead_id,
    intent: leadData.intent,
    tone: leadData.tone,
    urgency: leadData.urgency,
    confidence_score: leadData.confidence_score,
    conversion_tag: tag,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
  
  await supabase.from('growth_brain').insert({
    id: learningSnapshot.id,
    learning_snapshot: learningSnapshot,
    created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

### **Database Field**
```typescript
const logRecord = {
  id: actionId,
  lead_id,
  action,
  tag: tag || null,
  performed_by: performed_by || 'admin',
  conversion_outcome: isConversion || null, // ‚úÖ NEW FIELD
};
```

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lead_actions_conversion_outcome
ON public.lead_actions(conversion_outcome)
WHERE conversion_outcome = true;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.lead_actions.conversion_outcome IS 
'Tracks whether this action was a lead conversion (Converted/Converti tag). NULL for non-conversion actions, TRUE when lead is marked as converted.';
