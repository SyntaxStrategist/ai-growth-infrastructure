## 🎉 Status: **COMPLETE**

Build Status: **PASSING** ✓  
Soft Delete: **WORKING** ✓  
Permanent Delete: **IMPLEMENTED** ✓  
Bilingual: **FULLY SUPPORTED** ✓

---

## 🔧 **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. Updated Soft Delete Confirmation Dialog** ✅

**File:** `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New Text:**

**English:**
```
Confirm Delete — Are you sure you want to delete this lead? 
You can recover it later from the Deleted Leads tab.
```

**French:**
```
Confirmer la suppression — Êtes-vous sûr de vouloir supprimer ce lead ? 
Vous pourrez le récupérer plus tard depuis l'onglet Leads supprimés.
```

**Behavior:**
- Clicking "Delete" on an active lead shows this modal
- Confirms soft delete (sets `deleted = true`)
- Informs user they can recover later
- Lead moves to "Deleted Leads" tab

---

### **2. Permanent Delete Functionality** ✅

**New API Action:** `permanent_delete`

**File:** `src/app/api/lead-actions/route.ts`

**What it does:**
1. Deletes all related `lead_actions` records
2. Permanently deletes the lead from `lead_memory` table
3. Returns success without logging (record is gone)

**Code:**
```typescript
else if (action === 'permanent_delete') {
  console.log(`[LeadActions] PERMANENTLY deleting lead ${lead_id}...`);
  
  // First, delete all related actions
  const { error: actionsDeleteError } = await supabase
    .from('lead_actions')
    .delete()
    .eq('lead_id', lead_id);

  // Then permanently delete the lead record
  const { error: permanentDeleteError } = await supabase
    .from('lead_memory')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', lead_id);

  if (permanentDeleteError) {
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      success: false, 
      message: "Error permanently deleting lead" 
    }, { status: 500 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: true, 
    message: 'Lead permanently deleted successfully',
    permanent: true 
  });
}
```

---

### **3. Permanent Delete Button (Deleted Leads Tab)** ✅

**Location:** Deleted Leads tab only

**Button:**
- Icon: ❌
- Color: Red with glow effect
- Position: Next to "Reactivate" button
- Tooltip: "Delete Permanently" / "Supprimer définitivement"

**Code:**
```typescript
{activeTab === 'deleted' && (
  <div className="relative group">
    <button
      onClick={() => setConfirmPermanentDelete(lead.id)}
      className="p-2 rounded-lg bg-red-500/20 border border-red-500/40 text-red-400 hover:bg-red-500/30 hover:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(239,68,68,0.5)] hover:border-red-500/60 transition-all duration-100 text-xs"
    >
      ❌
    </button>
    <span className="absolute bottom-full left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 mb-2 px-2 py-1 bg-red-600 text-white text-[0.9rem] rounded opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-150 delay-150 whitespace-nowrap pointer-events-none z-10">
      {locale === 'fr' ? 'Supprimer définitivement' : 'Delete Permanently'}
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```
