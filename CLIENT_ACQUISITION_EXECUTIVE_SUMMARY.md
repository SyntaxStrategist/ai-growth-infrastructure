## Best Outreach Message (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **LinkedIn DM Template**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question about [Company]:

When leads fill out your website form, how fast do you typically respond?

Asking because most [industry] businesses average 47 hours, 
but your competitors are responding in 5 minutes.

I built an AI that responds in 30 seconds, qualifies leads 
automatically (intent, urgency, fit), and works in English + French.

Worth a 15-min demo?

- Michael

**Expected Response Rate:** 15%  
**Time Per Message:** 5 minutes (with personalization)

## ROI Framing (How to Justify Price)

### **For Real Estate Agencies**
```
Your average commission: $10,000
This costs: $299/month = $10/day

If this closes just ONE extra deal per year:
ROI = 33x

Our clients see 3-4 extra deals/year = 100-130x ROI
```

### **For Construction Companies**
```
Average renovation project: $25,000
This costs: $499/month = $17/day

If you recover just 2 "lost" quotes per year:
ROI = 100x

Plus save 15 hours/week on admin. Your time is worth?
```

### **For Marketing Agencies**
```
Use it yourself: $299/month ‚Üí Close 2 extra clients = 20x ROI

White-label it: Resell at $799/month
Your cost: $499/month
Profit per client: $300/month
3 clients = $900/month recurring profit = 180% profit margin
```

## Questions You'll Get (Quick Answers)

**"What if AI makes mistakes?"**  
‚Üí "AI never quotes prices or makes promises. It acknowledges, provides availability, includes booking link. Like a smart receptionist."

**"How is this different from chatbots?"**  
‚Üí "Chatbots ask scripted questions. We actually understand intent/urgency using advanced AI. Plus we analyze ALL leads, not just ones who click the bot."

**"Can we test it first?"**  
‚Üí "Yes. 7-day free trial, no credit card. I can set you up in 15 minutes right now."

**"We already use HubSpot/Salesforce"**  
‚Üí "Perfect. We integrate with it. We're not replacing your CRM ‚Äî we're making it smarter."

**"Need to think about it"**  
‚Üí "What specifically do you need to know? [Answer]. BTW, first 10 clients get 50% off. We're at 7/10. I'd hate for you to miss out on timing."
