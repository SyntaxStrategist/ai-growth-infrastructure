# 🚀 Converted Leads — Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR

The "Converted" lead tag is now available in both admin and client dashboards (English + French). When a lead is marked as converted, it:
- Moves to a dedicated "Converted Leads" section
- Is excluded from Active and Archived tabs
- Gets logged to `growth_brain` for AI learning
- Sets `conversion_outcome = true` in `lead_actions`
