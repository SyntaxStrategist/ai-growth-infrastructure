   - Indexes: automation_score (DESC), industry, region, contacted

2. **`prospect_outreach_log`** - Tracks all outreach attempts
   - Fields: prospect_id, subject, email_body, sent_at, opened_at, replied_at, status
   - Statuses: sent, opened, replied, bounced, ignored

3. **`prospect_industry_performance`** - Aggregates metrics by industry
   - Fields: industry, total_contacted, total_opened, total_replied, open_rate, reply_rate, priority_score
   - Purpose: Learning loop for continuous improvement

## Implementation Details

### 1. Test Data Crawler

**File:** `prospect-intelligence/crawler/test_data_generator.ts`

**Features:**
- Generates 10 realistic fake businesses per scan
- Supports multiple industries: Construction, Real Estate, Marketing, Legal, Healthcare, Home Services, Technology, Finance, Consulting, Insurance
- Creates realistic company names, websites, emails, and contact information
- Simulates automation need scores (45-95) based on industry patterns
- Includes metadata: response_time_minutes, has_autoresponder, estimated_company_size

**Sample Output:**
```javascript
{
  business_name: "Elite Construction Group",
  website: "https://www.elite-construction-group.com",
  contact_email: "contact@elite-construction-group.com",
  industry: "Construction",
  region: "CA",
  language: "en",
  automation_need_score: 87,
  response_time_minutes: 120,
  has_autoresponder: false
}
```

**API Integration:**
```typescript
// Simulates Apollo/LinkedIn/Crunchbase API
simulateThirdPartyAPI(industry, region, limit)
```

---

### 2. Prospect Scan Pipeline

**File:** `prospect-intelligence/prospect_pipeline.ts`

**Enhanced with:**
- Test mode toggle (uses test data generator when `testMode: true`)
- Automatic database saving via `saveProspectsToDatabase()`
- Deduplication by website URL
- Comprehensive logging at each stage

**Pipeline Stages:**

**Stage 1: Discovery**
- In test mode: generates fake prospects
- In production mode: uses Google Custom Search API
- Output: List of ProspectCandidate objects

**Stage 2: Form Testing**
- Tests contact forms for response time
- Detects autoresponders
- Measures response quality
- (Currently simulated in test mode)

**Stage 3: Scoring**
- Calculates automation_need_score (0-100)
- Based on: response time, autoresponder presence, industry, form quality
- High priority: score >= 70

**Stage 4: Outreach Generation**
- Calls `generateOutreachEmail()` for each prospect
- Templates vary by score:
  - 85+: Urgent template (critical gap focus)
  - 70-84: High-priority template (competitive advantage)
  - 50-69: Standard template (education & value)
- Personalizes with business_name, industry, region
- Bilingual support (EN/FR)

**Stage 5: Delivery**
- Saves to `prospect_outreach_log`
- Marks prospect as `contacted = true`
- In test mode: logs but doesn't actually send

**Stage 6: Database Persistence**
- All prospects saved to `prospect_candidates`
- Upserts based on website URL (avoids duplicates)
- Updates `last_tested`, `automation_need_score`, `contacted` status

---

### 3. Outreach Email Generation

**File:** `prospect-intelligence/outreach/generate_outreach_email.ts`

**Template Selection Logic:**
```typescript
if (automationScore >= 85) → Urgent Template
else if (automationScore >= 70) → High-Priority Template
else → Standard Template
```

**Personalization Variables:**
- `{business_name}` - Company name
- `{industry}` - Industry sector
- `{region}` - Geographic region
- `{contactName}` - Extracted from email if available
- `{responseTime}` - Current response delay

**Example Generated Email (High-Priority):**

```
Subject: Idea to improve Elite Construction Group

Hi,

I noticed that Elite Construction Group uses a standard contact form without instant auto-reply.

In the Construction space, the first to respond often wins the deal. That's why top companies are now using AI to respond in seconds — not hours.

Avenir AI helps you:
✅ Acknowledge every lead immediately
✅ Keep prospects engaged while you're busy
✅ Work in English and French automatically

Interested in seeing a quick demo?

### 4. Send Outreach API

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/prospect-intelligence/outreach`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "prospectId": "uuid",
  "testMode": true
}
```

**Process:**
1. Fetches prospect from database
2. Generates personalized email template
3. Logs outreach to `prospect_outreach_log`
4. Updates prospect `contacted = true`
5. In test mode: previews email in console

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "outreachId": "uuid",
    "prospectId": "uuid",
    "businessName": "Elite Construction Group",
    "email": "contact@elite-construction-group.com",
    "subject": "Idea to improve Elite Construction Group",
    "status": "sent",
    "message": "Outreach email sent successfully"
  }
}
```

---

### 5. Feedback Tracking System

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/prospect-intelligence/feedback`

**Features:**
- Updates outreach status: opened, replied, bounced, ignored
- Tracks timestamps for each status change
- Recalculates industry performance metrics
- Simulates random feedback for testing

**Request:**
```json
{
  "outreachId": "uuid",
  "status": "replied",
  "replyContent": "Interested in learning more...",
  "simulateRandom": false
}
```

**Batch Simulation:**
```
PUT /api/prospect-intelligence/feedback
{
  "count": 10
}
```

Simulates realistic feedback distribution:
- 45% opened
- 15% replied
- 40% ignored

**Metrics Calculation:**
```typescript
open_rate = (total_opened / total_contacted) × 100
reply_rate = (total_replied / total_contacted) × 100
priority_score = (open_rate × 0.4) + (reply_rate × 0.6)
```

**Performance Metrics Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/prospect-intelligence/feedback?type=metrics
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "metrics": [
      {
        "industry": "Construction",
        "total_contacted": 15,
        "total_opened": 8,
        "total_replied": 3,
        "open_rate": 53.33,
        "reply_rate": 20.00,
        "priority_score": 33.33
      }
    ],
    "overall": {
      "total_contacted": 50,
      "total_opened": 22,
      "total_replied": 8,
      "open_rate": 44.00,
      "reply_rate": 16.00
    }
  }
}
```

  cost_savings_monthly: "$2,400 - $4,000",
  conversion_rate_increase: "+25-40%"
}
```

**Visual Assets (Mock URLs):**
- Before screenshot: Form with no automation

### 7. Growth Brain / Learning Loop

**Implementation:**
- Industry performance tracked in `prospect_industry_performance` table
- Metrics recalculated after each feedback update
- Priority scores determine future prospecting focus
- High-performing industries get more attention in future scans

**Learning Algorithm:**
```typescript
priority_score = (open_rate × 0.4) + (reply_rate × 0.6)
```

Reply rate weighted higher because it indicates stronger interest.

**Continuous Improvement:**
1. Track which industries respond best
2. Adjust template personalization based on feedback
3. Optimize send times (future enhancement)
4. Refine scoring algorithm based on actual conversions

**Future Enhancements:**
- A/B test different email templates
- Machine learning for optimal send times
- Sentiment analysis on replies
- Predictive scoring for conversion probability

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Limits
- Test mode: 10 prospects per scan
- Production mode: 50 prospects per scan (configurable)
- Database: Supports thousands of prospects (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
- API rate limits: None (local processing)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Caching** - Cache industry performance metrics (Redis)
2. **Batch Processing** - Queue-based outreach sending (Bull/BullMQ)
3. **Async Jobs** - Background job processing for large scans
4. **CDN** - Cache proof visuals and comparison charts
5. **Database Indexing** - Already optimized with indexes on key fields

### Scalability Path
```
Current: Single-threaded, synchronous pipeline
↓
Phase 1: Add job queue for background processing
↓
Phase 2: Distributed crawling with worker pool
↓
Phase 3: Machine learning for predictive scoring
↓
Phase 4: Real-time webhook feedback integration
```
